This might be a surprising one... Why take on the most boring, tedious job of taking notes?? 

Because it is tedious and you are leading by example by doing it.
Because it also _gives you all the power_: the record of what happened in the meeting is YOUR record.
You can summarize what people are saying and innocently ask "did I capture what you said correctly?" Use it to _clarify_ what people actually mean.
