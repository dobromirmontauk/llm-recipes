Trust equation

Inverse trust pyramid
--> As you get more senior, people have fewer interactions with you. So everything you say has more weight. When a VP says "thanks for bringing it to my attention, I'll look into that" to a junior employee, that might be *the only interaction they will ever have* -- so if you do NOT look into it, you've burned 100% of your trust!!
