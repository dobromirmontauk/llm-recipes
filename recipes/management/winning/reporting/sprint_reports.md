Subject: [SPRINT REPORT] Schedule Team 9/18

The Schedule Team just completed the 9/18 Sprint. Our Sprint Retro is available [here for discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KzkffMrPCUaj0_fcPOSmv-GeHe-MKiXLTQg1fYnsIQ/edit), or below for your convenience:

**Goals**



1. Goal 1: GREEN. All work has been completed, although we did discover a few additional product requirements that have been added to the next spring (link to tickets).
2. Goal 2: YELLOW. We failed to complete QA on this feature due to some unexpected issues with XYZ. We expect to pass QA on 9/20.
3. Goal 3: RED. We were unable to complete much of the work on this because product was poorly defined / tech was poorly defined / we didn’t plan the complexity correctly / unexpected technical difficulties / etc etc 

**#Coolness**

Celebrate a win, a cool story, etc. 

**Velocity & Backlog**



* Points completed: 25 / 45 (56%)
* Last 6 sprint average: 32
* Points in backlog: 50 (1.6 sprints)
* Tickets in backlog (no points): 17
* Min/Avg/Max JIRA lead time: 5 days / 17 days / 30 days
* Avg PR to master time: 71 hours

**Retro**



* Fist-to-five expectations: 3, 4, 5
    * Generally the team had minor concerns about moving forward with this Sprint, mainly around the lack of details on some tickets. This indeed did bite us in the end when we failed to deliver on Goal 3. 
* Improvements from last sprint
    * We got much better at reviewing PRs and merging them quickly with our new process of “everyone reviews in the morning.”
    * Team communication has improved with having async check-ins on Range 2x/week.
* Commitments to improve next sprint
    * Engineering tickets are not being filed ahead of time with good documentation, making our estimates way off. We will spend more time on getting them clearly laid out and will aim to hit 90% of points this sprint.
    * PM will pull engineers into more Customer meetings or Gong calls to show them how their software is actually being used. We will do no less than 2 calls/sprint.
