# Reward Systems
Ah, motivating humans via extrinsic rewards... Remember this scene from 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'? 

```
Maroon: I got [Dumbo] on loan from Disney. Him and half the cast of Fantasia. [Opens blinds] Best part is... they work for peanuts!

Marron throws a handful of peanuts out of the window and Dumbo flies off sucking them up with his trunk.

Valiant: Well I don't work for peanuts. Where's the other fifty?

Maroon: Let's call the other fifty a carrot to finish the job.

Valiant: You've been hanging around rabbits too long.         
```

Unfortunately, engineers don't work for peanuts either (or carrots). Or maybe fortunately, because otherwise we all wouldn't have jobs. Guess we'll find out when GPT 6.5 comes out?

But... engineers don't just work for $$$ either. In our Hiring chapters we learn that $$$ are needed to prevent getting a 'no' from candidates... but they shouldn't get you to a 'yes'. Great engineers are motivated by WAY more than just money. Getting the money part straight though is no joke, so we will help you out there. The other part should be a lot more fun. 

The TellApart CEO, [Josh McFarland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshmcfarland/), used to say: "My job is to leave $ in your pocket and memories in your head." As managers it is our responsibility to make sure we help our engineers end up better-off financially, and with great stories to tell their families. YOLO.

# Unorganized
Drive book.

My thoughts re: Vic. His best advice to me: “do you remember when you were promoted? Do you remember when we launched Google+?”
Focus on the 5 year plan and not on short-term goals (e.g. promotion).
