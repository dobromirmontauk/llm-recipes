# Compensation Benchmarking

Probably the most important part of benchmarking is choosing the companies in the 'peer group'. If you are comparing
yourself to Google, Facebook, OpenAI... You will end up with very different numbers then if you choose a bunch of
Seed-stage startups. All the recipes below will likely have some flavor of this 'peer group' choice. There are basically
two ways to do it:

1. Choose the peer group yourself, and collect the data yourself. If you know a lot of other startups, this might be
   viable. It's likely how your CEO is doing it early on.
2. Use a per-defined peer group in one of the tools.

The peer groups there are defined by 'company stage':

You'll want to play with most of the options (we never use 'Number of Employees' since it doesn't seem very relevant).
See if there are massive differences between the numbers and use your judgement. For example, 'Valuation' is a very
frothy number that could be ~10x different not because of company fundamentals but because of the VC cycle. Capital
Raised is a stricter number (you either have the $ or you don't), but is also somewhat jumpy. Revenue is perhaps the
most consistent across time -- but not all revenue is created equally, either.

This is why there are compensation experts out there :P

# Recipes

## Third-Party Recipes

Here's a list of 3rd party tools to get benchmarks. Sometimes takeout is better than cooking yourself!

* [Pave](https://www.pave.com/benchmarking): they bought Option Impact which was previously our gold-standard, so I
  guess Pave is it now. You can get free benchmarks if you share your salary info with them in return.
    * <img width="1408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/open-leadership-management-cookbook/assets/50121200/7c94b13d-08a1-4f35-98c1-dcb188be614f">
* [Connery](https://www.conneryconsulting.com/services/compensation/): we saw this data being used ~5 years ago but not
  that much anymore. Perhaps they aren't popular in the startup space now?
* [Carta](https://carta.com/equity-management/compensation/): Carta has grown big in equity management, but we've never
  used their benchmarking. Would love some opinions on this.
* [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/products/data/peer-data/?tk=nav): never used them, would love someone's opinion on
  this.
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/): self-reported, we wouldn't really trust this as a primary source.
* [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/): self-reported, we wouldn't really trust this as a primary source.

## Partner Recipes

Several of your partners likely have great salary data and you can ask them for benchmarks directly:

* VCs: they usually have access to the tools above (if you don't) and also know how much their other startups are
  paying. This is particularly useful for roles that don't have a lot of market data (very senior roles or specialized
  roles).
* Recruiting Firms: ditto, they are making offers all the time, and so they'll usually have some data.
* Your recruiters: if you are actively hiring in the market for a role, your recruiters are probably asking the 'how
  much are you making right now?' question.
    * If they aren't, make them start asking!
    * Gather all of this in a spreadsheet so you have your own market data going forward.

Note that these partners don't have the incentives you have and so they may over-inflate or under-inflate the data. You
get what you pay for.

## Dobromir's Benchmark Recipe

This is the recipe I used to put together our first set of compensation benchmarks when I joined Doxel in 2019.

1. I called my friends at Abnormal Security and asked them for their compensation benchmarks.
1. I remembered some of the comp numbers from Twitter (still fresh) and Google, and had friends at other large
   companies, so I added those in to see how big a difference it was.
    1. This is also useful for benchmarking equity value at some point in time. I.e. 'our startup equity has to turn
       into this many $ for it to be a better offer than going to Google...'
    1. Big company data is obviously not the right number for a startup, but it is useful. Candidates will be willing to
       take 10-20% pay cuts to join a startup, but they will rarely be willing to take 50% pay cuts (on the salary
       side). If your pay is MASSIVELY off, you may spin your wheels on the hiring side and get a lot of 'NO's -- or
       weak hires.
1. I put together
   the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BuM5ar1LTmhLUVN96lVS1vZM3nGbEUKBQhUDyvtuU58/edit#gid=1332198471)
   to track the different ranges.
    1. ![image](https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/llm-recipes/assets/50121200/19049448-7bd7-4c98-9de3-25230a142b26)
1. I enlisted an HR ally to do the market benchmarking research from that point on.
    1. You are biased so no matter what numbers you come up with your CEO will cut them in half. Having a non-partisan
       ally painstakingly spend 100 hours building an unimpeachable market report should convince her to only cut it by
       1/3. It's also nice to have someone to blame when the numbers are still WAY too high and your CEO is really mad
       that engineers are paid too much.
    1. Hand your HR ally the spreadsheet and ask them to use Pave or their friends to come up with recommended salaries
       at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles.
    1. Give them 1-2 weeks since it can take them time to make friends and extract this info...
1. Send the benchmark to your CEO for his opinion.
    1. Expect not to hear anything back until you come up with your engineering budget and he's shocked about the size
       of the number.
