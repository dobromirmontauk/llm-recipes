# Compensation Benchmarking

## Dobromir's Benchmark Recipe
This is the recipe I used to put together our first set of compensation benchmarks when I joined Doxel in 2019.


1. Use an ally.
2. Call your VP/HoE friends.
3. 

Start by putting together a draft spreadsheet of market comp bands that your HR ally can fill out. Something like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BuM5ar1LTmhLUVN96lVS1vZM3nGbEUKBQhUDyvtuU58/edit#gid=1332198471):

This is mostly to help them work within the template you defined so you don't have to re-do all their work later and pretend they saved you time.

Next, give them the spreadsheet, and ask them to use 1-2 more sources from the salary comps recipes. This can take anywhere from a week to a month; it's that rare occassion when they can go golfing with their HR friends and call it 'work', so give them some space.

Big companies and discounts

Try to avoid the "this is how much Google paid me so that's what the market must be" argument. Everybody knows Google is cheap, OpenAI salaries are closer to our real value as engineers!
Peer group is important. 

You are biased so no matter what numbers you come up with your CEO will cut them in half. Having a non-partisan ally painstakingly spend 100 hours building an unimpeachable market report should convince her to only cut it by 1/3. It's also nice to have someone to blame when the numbers are still WAY too high and your CEO is really mad that engineers are paid too much.
