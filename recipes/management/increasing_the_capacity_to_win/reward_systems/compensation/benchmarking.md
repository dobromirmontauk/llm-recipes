# Compensation Benchmarking
Probably the most important part of benchmarking is choosing the companies in the 'peer group'. If you are comparing yourself to Google, Facebook, OpenAI... You will end up with very different numbers then if you choose a bunch of Seed-stage startups. All the recipes below will likely have some flavor of this 'peer group' choice. There are basically two ways to do it:

1. Choose the peer group yourself, and collect the data yourself. If you know a lot of other startups, this might be viable. It's likely how your CEO is doing it early on.
2. Use a per-defined peer group in one of the tools.

The peer groups there are defined by 'company stage':

You'll want to play with most of the options (we never use 'Number of Employees' since it doesn't seem very relevant). See if there are massive differences between the numbers and use your judgement. For example, 'Valuation' is a very frothy number that could be ~10x different not because of company fundamentals but because of the VC cycle. Capital Raised is a stricter number (you either have the $ or you don't), but is also somewhat jumpy. Revenue is perhaps the most consistent across time -- but not all revenue is created equally, either. 

This is why there are compensation experts out there :P 

# Recipes

## Third-Party Recipes
Here's a list of 3rd party tools to get benchmarks. Sometimes takeout is better than cooking yourself!

* [Pave](https://www.pave.com/benchmarking): they bought Option Impact which was previously our gold-standard, so I guess Pave is it now. You can get free benchmarks if you share your salary info with them in return.
  * <img width="1408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/open-leadership-management-cookbook/assets/50121200/7c94b13d-08a1-4f35-98c1-dcb188be614f">
* [Connery](https://www.conneryconsulting.com/services/compensation/): we saw this data being used ~5 years ago but not that much anymore. Perhaps they aren't popular in the startup space now?
* [Carta](https://carta.com/equity-management/compensation/): Carta has grown big in equity management, but we've never used their benchmarking. Would love some opinions on this.
* [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/products/data/peer-data/?tk=nav): never used them, would love someone's opinion on this.
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/): self-reported, we wouldn't really trust this as a primary source. 
* [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/): self-reported, we wouldn't really trust this as a primary source. 

## Partner Recipes
Several of your partners likely have great salary data and you can ask them for benchmarks directly:

* VCs: they usually have access to the tools above (if you don't) and also know how much their other startups are paying. This is particularly useful for roles that don't have a lot of market data (very senior roles or specialized roles).
* Recruiting Firms: ditto, they are making offers all the time, and so they'll usually have some data. 

Note that these partners don't have the incentives you have and so they may over-inflate or under-inflate the data. You get what you pay for.

## Dobromir's Benchmark Recipe
This is the recipe I used to put together our first set of compensation benchmarks when I joined Doxel in 2019.


1. Use an ally.
2. Call your VP/HoE friends.
3. 

Start by putting together a draft spreadsheet of market comp bands that your HR ally can fill out. Something like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BuM5ar1LTmhLUVN96lVS1vZM3nGbEUKBQhUDyvtuU58/edit#gid=1332198471):

This is mostly to help them work within the template you defined so you don't have to re-do all their work later and pretend they saved you time.

Next, give them the spreadsheet, and ask them to use 1-2 more sources from the salary comps recipes. This can take anywhere from a week to a month; it's that rare occassion when they can go golfing with their HR friends and call it 'work', so give them some space. 




# Unorganized

Your candidates
Big companies and discounts
VC data
Self -reported
Pave data

Try to avoid the "this is how much Google paid me so that's what the market must be" argument. Everybody knows Google is cheap, OpenAI salaries are closer to our real value as engineers!
Peer group is important. 

You are biased so no matter what numbers you come up with your CEO will cut them in half. Having a non-partisan ally painstakingly spend 100 hours building an unimpeachable market report should convince her to only cut it by 1/3. It's also nice to have someone to blame when the numbers are still WAY too high and your CEO is really mad that engineers are paid too much.
