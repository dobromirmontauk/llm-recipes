# Comp Planning 
Compensation planning is one of the most important -- and most boring -- things you do as an engineering manager. If you are very lucky, you have a whole, competent department handling this for you. If you are unlucky, you have an incompetent department getting it all wrong (and causing you to lose engineers). Most of us startup folks will be in the middle: nobody does comp planning for us, so we get to be that incompetent department. Yay. The goal of these recipes is to extract you from incompetence as quickly as possible. Because the postmortem meetings don't run themselves.

Why is comp planning so important? Think of the engineering department from the perspective of the CEO. It's probably the biggest line item in her budget - scary. Worse, there are no metrics that can tell her if the department is doing well. No sales $ numbers to hit. No marketing click-through rates or leads generated. No Operations efficiency trends. In fact, when things go badly, you probably go ask for money, and when things are going well, you ask for more money. Do you think she really wants to hear that all those super-expensive engineers she's paying for are going to cost her EVEN MORE NEXT YEAR?? 

So how do you convince your CEO that raises do make sense? Because if you don't, and you lose a couple of your superstars, she'll blame you for mismanaging them and fire your ass. One easy tip: never propose a raise for yourself, save all that cash for your team. And then, off-cycle, make a big fuss that you are underpaid and have an offer from OpenAI. Sure, it'll burn a huge budget hole in her temp-CFO's spreadsheet, but you can probably end up the hero too by "finding" some $50K you can cut from your AWS spend. All in a day's work.

## Preparation
Before you start comp planning you should prepare a few key ingredients:

1. [Compensation philosophy TODO](TODO): How your company chooses to reward its people has a huge effect on the approach to the plan. There might be a small gap between your philosphy and your CEO's, so it's worth investigating this. You probably want to pay top 90% of the market in cash & equity while she was thinking some occasional launch swag and a monthly motivating All Hands speech might be enough. I'm sure you can resolve this in a 15 minute unprepared 1:1.
2. Human Resource [allies TODO](TODO): You are biased so no matter what numbers you come up with your CEO will doubt them. Having a non-partisan ally gather the data for you will save you a lot of negotiation later.

### Dobromir's Cash & Equity Calculator
This is an [example calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BuM5ar1LTmhLUVN96lVS1vZM3nGbEUKBQhUDyvtuU58/edit#gid=1226519420) that I copied from Twitter and my friends at Abnormal. Once you have your compensation philosophy set, and you've done your comparables, a calculator like this makes it a LOT easier to determine the reasonable numbers for offers. I also put together [this Miro version](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVND-VLJg=/) with comments to help explain what the various parts of the calculator are doing.

Ingredients:
1. Comparables
     1. Ideally your own data too -- how is your team doing?
3. Comp philosophy (50th-75th on cash, no bonus,)
4. Allies in HR
5. Lots of patience
6. Understand the business constraints.
    6. E.g. equity pool
7. 

Recipe:

1. Have an ally run the numbers. 
2. Expect that your CEO won't care about comp philosophy until they get the sticker shock

Misc
1. They will go to their friends and "discover" that we are overpaying our engineers.
2. No matter how you slice & dice the comparables, they will claim you got it wrong. So don't worry about it too much in the first pass.
3. Expect to throw away the first one.
4. In the end, they probably won't care about individual engineers, even though they'll ask about it. They'll care about the top-line number. And they'll cut it anywhere from 20-50%.
5. Dont' peanut butter your raises. Give them to the people that matter most, because you won't have enough $ anyhow.
6.
