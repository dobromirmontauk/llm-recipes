# Compensation Philosophy
 There might be a small gap between your philosphy and your CEO's, so it's worth investigating this. You probably want to pay top 90% of the market in cash & equity while she was thinking some occasional launch swag and a monthly motivating All Hands speech might be enough. I'm sure you can resolve this in a 15 minute unprepared 1:1.

# Why 'Philosophy'? 
Religion or magic might be just as accurate. Doesn't really come from first principles. 
 
# What are the questions?
1. What is the minimum we pay employees? 50% of market? 25%?
1. What is the maximum? 50%? 75%? 90%?
1. BANDS:
    1. Startups: You want to pay the minimum you can get away with. Extends the runway.
    
1. Do we break the bands? If so, when/how?
1. How do we want bands to overlap across levels?
1. Do we have levels?
1. Cash/equity balance?
1. Planned Bonuses?
1. Unplanned bonuses?
    1. Yearly?
    1. Ad-hoc?
1. What is the value of the equity?
    1. Founders are thinking of a $10B company... so the equity is HUGE! They have to think this way.
1. Vesting schedule
1. Vacation / PTO / etc
    1. Startups are doing UNLIMITED because that avoids debt on their books (!!)
    

 
 
# Unorganized
-Different job families should have different philosophies. No reason to pay your Ops team crazy equity. Or some of your FE roles may not be that important?


Pay everyone top dollar --> cuts the company runway + dillutes equity a ton.
Pay everyone top equity, low $ --> unable to hire some of the talent you need (only high-risk people), especially senior folks (more likely to have families/other obligations).

No philosophy --> might be right in the beginning. "Do whatever it takes" --> management debt.
