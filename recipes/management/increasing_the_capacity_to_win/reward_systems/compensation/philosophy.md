# Compensation Philosophy

Compensation 'philosophy' is the misnomer for how your company thinks about paying its employees. Philosophy usually
refers to the study of truths, the search for right and wrong, or the seeking of the meaning of life. We doubt such deep
first principles thinking influenced your compensation structure. Your
CEO most likely [cargo-culted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) the comp approach from one of his college buddy's startups.

At worst, he truly believes engineers just work for ~~peanuts~~, I mean stock options.

Since a slight gap might exist between your recommendations and your boss's preference, you might find yourself needing to
spend some time bridging it so you can get back to the business of hiring engineers and building cooler things than comp
spreadsheets. Feel free to start with that 5-minute unprepared conversation in your next 1:1 you were planning on
having. Then, come back here for some recipes that might actually work.

# Why Do You Need A Comp Philosophy?

Simply put, you need a comp philosophy because no matter what you do, you have one. People want to know how you will decide how much to pay them, and since you are making those decisions, there is some better-or-worse system you are using to decide... So there you go, that's your 'philosophy'. It might be as simple as "we don't have a comp philosophy"! Or, you might not be _aware_ of your own comp philosophy. Or you may not be comfortable communicating it... 

A perhaps a better question is, "why do you need a _published_ comp philosophy?" You might not (see some of the recipes below). The right way to judge this is: 

    Would publishing a comp philosophy save you time, save you money, or save you both?

How can a comp philosophy do that?? When employees start feeling like compensation isn't fair, that it's _negotiated_ more than _earned_, they will start devoting their energy into increasing their own compensation instead of making the team win. That will suck away your time in negotiations and replacing disgruntled employees, it'll likely cost you more as you'll give in to some of the negotiations, and it will decrease the productivity of your team. 

If you notice this leech starting to suck your blood... put together a comp philosophy and _stick to it_. 


# Recipes

Compensation philosophy is very well-written about now so a simple Google search will give you tons of resources. For
example, a good set of links are available
at [OysterHR](https://www.oysterhr.com/library/14-compensation-philosophy-examples-to-guide-your-global-pay-decisions).
We'll focus our recipes on some of the less obvious approaches.

## The Early Startup Compensation Philosophy Recipe

When you are very small, like <10 people or $1-2M in capital, the compensation philosophy is very simple: "don't go
bankrupt." Every hire you make brings you closer to bankruptcy. So the simplest recipe is the following:

"We don't have a compensation philosophy because we are too busy proving that our product is useful to someone. When
we've done that and have raised a Series A, we'll reconsider this position. In the mean time, please remember that every
raise we give you or other individual we hire shortens our runway, so IT MUST also come with a significant acceleration
of product/market fit risk reduction."

Then, do everything in a case-by-case basis. Take on the [Management Debt](/tools/management_debt.md) for now.

## Dobromir's Series B Comp Philosophy Recipe

Congratulations, you survived to Series A (at least). It might be time to pay off some of that management debt you
accrued around compensation philosophy. The trick, like in all startup moments, is to do the _least work_ that gives you
the outcome you need. If you survive to Series B or later, you'll always have a chance to come clean this up. If you
don't... then it doesn't matter anyhow.

The recipe roughly follows this format. I'll have more details in the sections below.

1. Start with identifiying the problems (a version of [Working Backwards](/tools/working_backwards.md)).
    1. What problems with comp are _slowing down the business_? What problems are just irking you?
1. Ask the [Right Questions](/tools/right_question.md)
    1. What is _simplest way_ to solve those problems? What is the debt you are taking on if you do that?
1. Create a [Pressure Test](/tools/pressure_test.md)
    1. What are the _effects on the budget_ if you adopt this proposal? How much are you cutting your runway? Is it
       worth it?
1. Write up a [Proposal](/tools/written_proposal.md).
    1. Can you express your pros & cons in an unbiased way?
1. Get buy-in from keywstakeholders
    1. 
1. Roll out to your team.
    1. Otherwise, the philosophy isn't real. This is the hardest part!

### Identifying the Problem

Life isn't fair!

### Asking the Right Question

1. What is the maximum the company can afford?
1. What is the minimum we pay employees? 50% of market? 25%?
1. What is the maximum? 50%? 75%? 90%?
1. BANDS:
    1. Startups: You want to pay the minimum you can get away with. Extends the runway.

1. Do we break the bands? If so, when/how?
1. How do we want bands to overlap across levels?
    1. This is important re: promotions.
1. How do we pay ICs vs managers?
1. Do we have levels?
1. Cash/equity balance?
1. Planned Bonuses?
1. Unplanned bonuses?
    1. Yearly?
    1. Ad-hoc?
1. What is the value of the equity?
    1. Founders are thinking of a $10B company... so the equity is HUGE! They have to think this way.
1. Vesting schedule
1. Vacation / PTO / etc
    1. Startups are doing UNLIMITED because that avoids debt on their books (!!)
1. How often do we change our bands?

# Unorganized

-Different job families should have different philosophies. No reason to pay your Ops team crazy equity. Or some of your
FE roles may not be that important?

Pay everyone top dollar --> cuts the company runway + dillutes equity a ton.
Pay everyone top equity, low $ --> unable to hire some of the talent you need (only high-risk people), especially senior
folks (more likely to have families/other obligations).

No philosophy --> might be right in the beginning. "Do whatever it takes" --> management debt.
