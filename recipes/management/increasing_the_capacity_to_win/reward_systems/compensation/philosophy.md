# Compensation Philosophy

Compensation 'philosophy' is the misnomer for how your company thinks about paying its employees. Philosophy usually
refers to the study of truths, the search for right and wrong, or the seeking of the meaning of life. We doubt such deep
first principles thinking influenced your compensation structure. Your
CEO most likely [cargo-culted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) the comp approach from one of his college buddy's startups.

At worst, he truly believes engineers just work for ~~peanuts~~, I mean stock options.

Since a slight gap might exist between your recommendations and your boss's preference, you might find yourself needing to
spend some time bridging it so you can get back to the business of hiring engineers and building cooler things than comp
spreadsheets. Feel free to start with that 5-minute unprepared conversation in your next 1:1 you were planning on
having. Then, come back here for some recipes that might actually work.

# Why Do You Need A Comp Philosophy?

Simply put, you need a comp philosophy because no matter what you do, you have one. People want to know how you will decide how much to pay them, and since you are making those decisions, there is some better-or-worse system you are using to decide... So there you go, that's your 'philosophy'. It might be as simple as "we don't have a comp philosophy"! Or, you might not be _aware_ of your own comp philosophy. Or you may not be comfortable communicating it... 

A perhaps a better question is, "why do you need a _published_ comp philosophy?" You might not (see some of the recipes below). The right way to judge this is: 

    Would publishing a comp philosophy save you time, save you money, or save you both?

How can a comp philosophy do that?? When employees start feeling like compensation isn't fair, that it's _negotiated_ more than _earned_, they will start devoting their energy into increasing their own compensation instead of making the team win. That will suck away your time in negotiations and replacing disgruntled employees, it'll likely cost you more as you'll give in to some of the negotiations, and it will decrease the productivity of your team. 

If you notice this leech starting to suck your blood... put together a comp philosophy and _stick to it_. 


# Recipes

Compensation philosophy is very well-written about now so a simple Google search will give you tons of resources. For
example, a good set of links are available
at [OysterHR](https://www.oysterhr.com/library/14-compensation-philosophy-examples-to-guide-your-global-pay-decisions).
We'll focus our recipes on some of the less obvious approaches.

## The Early Startup Compensation Philosophy Recipe

When you are very small, like <10 people or $1-2M in capital, the compensation philosophy is very simple: "don't go
bankrupt." Every hire you make brings you closer to bankruptcy. So the simplest recipe is the following:

"We don't have a compensation philosophy because we are too busy proving that our product is useful to someone. When
we've done that and have raised a Series A, we'll reconsider this position. In the mean time, please remember that every
raise we give you or other individual we hire shortens our runway, so IT MUST also come with a significant acceleration
of product/market fit risk reduction."

Then, do everything in a case-by-case basis. Take on the [Management Debt](/tools/management_debt.md) for now.

## Dobromir's Series B Comp Philosophy Recipe

Congratulations, you survived to Series A (at least). It might be time to pay off some of that management debt you
accrued around compensation philosophy. The trick, like in all startup moments, is to do the _least work_ that gives you
the outcome you need. If you survive to Series B or later, you'll always have a chance to come clean this up. If you
don't... then it doesn't matter anyhow.

Here is the outline of my recipe. I'll add more details as requested by folks.

1. Identify the technical problems that need [A-level talent](/recipes/management/increasing_the_capacity_to_win/hiring/talent.md#A-LevelTalent)
    1.  I used to believe that you wanted to hire the best possible engineers for every role. That was before I met my first startup engineering budget... which is *slim*. When it turns out those perfect resumes cost 30% more (some maybe even 2-3x more!!), then you start asking: "is this a problem that a B-player can solve?"
    1. Every startup has 'end-of-the-business' technical problems, and 'good-enough' technical problems. Hopefully, a LOT more of the latter than the former. If you can segregate your problems, and therefore your team quality, you should have a comp philosophy that reflects where it makes sense to invest your $.
    1. I use job roles for this segregation. For example, we might pay everyone at the same band levels (50-75%, see below), but we divide engineers into 'Application Engineer', 'Fullstack Engineer', 'Backend Engineer', and 'ML Engineer', with each job family being comp'd higher than the previous one.
1. Choose a 'local market' comp philosophy.
    1. Remote talent can be 50-80% cheaper than local talent -- if that is your comp philosophy. Some companies choose to pay all engineers, regardless of location, the same.
    1. I think that is silly for smaller startups. It's borderline irresponsible, since it draws down on your runway AND removes the incentive to hire remote talent. It also chains employees to your company, if they are getting multiples of what the market offers -- which will create headaches for you when misaligned employees refuse to quit and aren't delivering results.
1. Pay your ICs and Managers the same.
    1. Or maybe even pay your managers slightly less (that's what Google did). You want to have a culture of 'building things is the most valuable thing here', and you can emphasize with a compensation philosophy that rewards builders more than managers.
    1. When the company is smaller, I would opt to have the pay be the same so individuals can shift between IC/EM roles without it creating any weird comp ripple effects. It also helps avoid people trying to become managers so they can get paid more - or avoiding it because they might end up paid less. 
1. Have a few 'exceptions' built into your philosophy.
    1. There are always a few roles or special individuals where I'm willing to go 'top-of-market' because they can change the course of the entire business. 
    1. I try to keep this to 5-10% of my org, say 1-2 individuals in the first 20. You can't have too many of them because (a) they will won't stand out if there are a >10% and (b) you need to make back the $ you spend on them elsewhere, either by hiring fewer people OR by hiring other engineers for less.    
    1. Build your exception into the salary, not bonuses. See the bonus section below that explains why.
1. For earlier startups, try to go as low on cash as you can and compensate by going higher on the equity side.
    1. I've found several very strong benefits of this approach:
        1. It significantly increases your runway. If you save $20K on average per engineer, that's $200K/year for a team of 10. That kind of money might save you from having to do layoffs when the sales plan doesn't get hit...
        1. You attract more 'startup-y' employees. Not everyone should work at a startup, and a lower cash offer filters out employees who are looking for the comfort they won't find anyways.
        1. OBJECTIONS: some people will complain about this recipe and say it discriminates against individuals who want to work at a startup and would thrive there, but simply can't afford to make less. This is true. I have a few responses to this objection.
            1. Put them into your exception bucket above. It's not a free lunch, though, the money you are giving them is coming out from somewhere else...
            1. The world isn't fair. If you can't afford the financial risk of working at a startup, you shouldn't work there. Just like if you can't afford the risk to life & limb of climbing, you shouldn't climb, and if you can't afford the risk to your pocketbook from gambling in Vegas, you shouldn't gamble. You can't have your cake & eat it too. 
            3. "The purpose of a startup is to grow into an entity that **can take care of its employees**. A startup is not born that way. We would be foolish to expect a 4-year old child to carry a 50lb bag of flour; why should we expect a 3-year old company to carry a $300K/year engineer? If we burden children too early, they won't grow up right. If we burden startups too early, they may not grow up at all. 
    1. At Doxel, we chose to be at the 50th-75th on cash and 75th-90th on equity for most job families. 
        1. We had a lot of difficult technical problems: classical CV, deep ML CV, big data pipelines, complex 3D FE apps... so we had to attract quite a few A-players.
        1. We were still in [Product/Market Fit](/ingredients/business.md#Product-Market-Fit) phase so we had to conserve cash, so we couldn't go to 75th-90th. We made up for that by giving higher equity numbers.
        1. We also had a few non-comp advantages which helped attract talent, even if they got higher offers elsewhere:
            1. A large set of very interesting technical problems.
            1. A strong growth-mindset management bench.
            1. A couple of those superstars that attracted other great engineers.
    1. At a profitable startup growing quickly the calculus changes a lot. Equity becomes very expensive and cash is cheap.
        1. Taxes on any profit means cash is discounted.
        1. The mix might be more like 75th-90th on cash and 25-50th on equity, since the risk premium on the equity is also quite a bit lower.
    1. REMEMBER: cash/equity mix should CHANGE as people get more senior. This is because more senior individuals have more ability to drive overall company success and therefore should be exposed to that risk/reward. Junior engineers might have 10-30% of their target comp come from equity; Sr. Engineers might have 50%, Staff+ maybe up to 80%. Build this into your philosophy.
1. Make your level bands overlap.
    1. I like to have my bands overlap 10-20% with the next/previous band. It relieves the pressure of having to promote someone in order to pay them more. I've had numerous situations where people were pushing for a promotion when (a) they weren't ready for the next level and (b) they wanted more pay, not more responsibility. 
    1. Each next level should add real responsibilities (see the [expectations recipes](/recipes/management/increasing_the_capacity_to_win/growing/expectations/)). That means it should be decoupled, mostly, from 'impact-based pay'. By having the bands overlap a little you remove some of this pressure to promote to unlock pay.
    1. Sometimes that means I need to extend them a little beyond what the market comparisons would recommend. You might want to be explicit when you are doing that. Or you might want to do bonuses instead. 
1. Don't do explicit performance bonuses.
    1. You can 'break bands' by having a performance-based bonus structure instead. For example, when I was at Google they had a 'bonus target' of 15% for Sr. Eng (20% for Staf and 25% for Principal, if IRC). However, the multiplier could go up to 3x. So if you met expectations, you got 15%, if you exceeded, maybe 20-30%, and if you Very Strongly Exceeded, 30-45%! That way an individual technically at the same pay level as me could still make 30% more.
    1. So why not use the same approach at a startup? Don't annual bonuses encourage over & above performance, and help save the company money if people don't deliver results? I don't like these built-in performance bonuses at startups because they create a very weird dynamic.
        1. TODO(dmontauk): the arguments below are not done. Clean them up.
        1. Bonuses encourage a 'short-term value' mindset whereas startups need a 'long-term value' mindset.
            * They are cash in the employee's pocket, and that's it -- the cycle is reset and they need to 
            * Continuous value vs binary value.
            * Startups need to build lasting revenue streams to have any market worth, since their worth is (theoretically) the Discounted Future Cash Flow. It's not always clear in the SHORT TERM if a given project or effort leads to an increase in DCF. For example, at Doxel we spent months building a 'budget prediction' product. We could have bonused the entire team on hitting delivery dates, product quality, even customer usage metrics. In the end, it was the wrong product for us to build -- it didn't have PMF for various reasons -- but it took a year for us to figure that out. So the bonuses would have disconnected compensation from the results that matter: startup success. 
        1. Bonuses encourage a 'me vs them' mindset whereas startups need a 'we're in this together' mindset.
            *. Grow your own pie, instead of everyone's pie. Selfish vs selfless. Make yourself more prosperous vs make the tribe more prosperous.
        1. Bonuses give tacit permission to work less hard, whereas startups need everyone working at 100%.
            * The flip side of 'work harder -> have more impact -> make more money' is 'if you are OK with less money, you can just work less'. You don't want people thinking that way at startups.
            * Big companies you can afford more ROCKSTARS and fewer SUPERSTARS, and you can use bonuses as a scalaeble tool to have people self-separate.
            * At startups, everyone should be working their butt off. You can't afford to have anyone doing the minimum, just 'meeting expectations' -- if you have those folks, you should be firing them.
        1. Bonuses burn people out when they *need* to hit the high end to make ends meet.
            * People stress out if they are going to get get that bonus or not. It distracts them from work. Increases the risk of burnout, since any slack time could be "no bonus" time.
        1. Bonuses send the signal you don't think someone is worth that salary, which lowers trust. Startups need high trust to work.
            * Putting it into the salary shows you trust them. "I'm going to pay you at the top of the band/above market price/etc, because I believe you are going to deliver incredible results in this role..."
    1. See Drive book.
1. Do ad-hoc bonuses (cash or equity)
    1. Even at startups I'll see superhuman levels of effort sometimes. All-nighters fixing the product before a customer meeting. Taking ALL of the on call burden so a team can sprint on the next release. Explicitly rewarding this _effort_ can sometimes improve the culture and lead to more such effort in the future. 
    1. Rewarding certain virtues as well: great team work, ownership, etc. Makes the virtues real.
    1. TODO(dmontauk): finish this section.
1. Have a well-defined yearly review cycle that does depend on performance. 
    1. See my recipes under [planning](planning.md). In your published philosophy you can skip that step for now as long as you say "we will have a yearly review cycle that ends on April 1st, the details of which will be determined later."
1. Keep a simple vacation policy.
    1. Many startups today are doing unlimited PTO. While that sounds nice, they are really doing it because it removes the 'PTO debt' on their books (really!). The downside of an unlimited PTO policy is that your team doesn't take enough PTO, or that they take too much. If you hire the right folks, and have a good sense of the burnout pulse, it can be a good, simple way to manage the team.
    1. If you haven't built those abilities yet you might be better off with a fixed PTO policy, like '3 weeks a year + 1 week for Thanksgiving + 1 week for Christmas/New Year's'. 
1. [PRESSURE TEST](/tools/pressure_test.md) your comp philosophy!
    1. Your comp philosophy is pointless if you can't afford it. It's also dead on arrival if it doesn't get support from your key stakeholders.
    1. You need 2 documents to really run a good pressure test:
        1. Example engineering budget. That means running a quick version of the comp planning process, using this new comp philosophy. It means figuring out how much you would have to change *your existing team* and how much it would cost to hire your next 6-12 months of headcount. Put this together, explaing it might be 10-20% off from the final comp planning process, and get your CEO/CFO to bless it.
        1. Draft document that the **entire company** will have access to. This will separate which parts of your philosophy can be publicly discussed and which cannot. Draft it up and get your CEO to bless it. Then run it by your EMs and see what holes they poke in it.
