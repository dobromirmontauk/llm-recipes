# Background
These are rough notes I gathered talking to a16z about Comp in 2019 or so. Not organized. 

# Notes

1. How do we set ISO and salary ranges for various roles? I've looked at a16z and Connery data (and other public sources) a year ago and the disparities were pretty wide. I'm curious why, how things have changed with COVID, and how to think about the scales when a business is "in between" various milestones (e.g. not just a "Series A" company anymore, but not crossed the "Series B" threshold officially yet). 
    1. Use capital raised instead of Series. 10 years ago A vs B meant something; definitely not the case now. Narrow your marketing set to companies that “look for you”.
    2. You can do that in Option Impact/Advanced HR data. [did you participate in this survey?] no - you need to provide your data, then you get access to it, usually for free. Extremely helpful, will give you the filter you need. 
    3. $15M you want to go to Radford data.
    4. We can connect you.
    5. 
2. Communicate them to candidates. What is an effective way you've seen translating non-liquid comp to candidates, especially coming from liquid companies, so they understand the risk/reward tradeoffs?
    6. NEVER attach a value to what you are giving. Lots of employment risk here. “We think this is a $20B company”, everyone asked “where is my $13B?” People lose their risk sensitivity. Good companies don’t do that.
    7. You want to establish connection between how THEY will drive shareholder value. “If we can capture this segment of this market we know we will have a big chunk of TAM…” “Our product roadmap looks like X, if you join us and execute on it, it WILL drive shareholder value.” Then you will have success.
    8. More so than if you try to compare options to RSUs, explain the total impact…
    9. Equity you want people’s ability to affect it.
    10. DON’T make it feel like a roll of the dice. 
    11. Tom: focus the entire conversation on the upside. How big are we compared to TAM, how big we can get - let people do the last part of the math. 
    12. Equity package is ultimately a litmus test for risk aversion. You need people who can take on more risk - cash is king. Upside opportunity on the equity. 
    13. Do NOT share total comp at $1B. Educating your candidates on how to be better candidates. Even if you are competing with another company - you’ve taught them to ask the right questions. We are going to create a better, educated candidate. 
    14. People want to work on interesting, unique hard problems. 
3. Percentiles
    15. 50-75% cash, 90% equity - does that make sense?
    16. Pick something narrower on the cash - a big difference between top/bottom.
    17. Focus on what is the culture/relationship to compensation you want to create internally? 90th you will definitely get risky people. Probably an outlier.
    18. Get a range for next 12-18 months, figure out if you’ve got the pool available to grant.
    19. Most companies don’t go below 50th - especially with Capital Raise. Fungibility of compensation that is consistent. 
    20. You won’t be able to compete with Goog/FB/etc… 
    21. If you go up for cash - the likelihood you are getting people who are less-and-less risky. 
    22. REDACTED: “cash seems about right, equity seems low.” $160-$170k for 50% range - you might be giving them more cash. 
    23. “I need people to make independent decisions and be able to prioritize the same way because they have the same incentives - drive shareholder value”
4. How to set refreshers for internal employees. We have a few who have been here >2 years and have started asking about new grants.
    24. 2.5-3 years 
    25. Way too small to think of a formal refresh program. Manage it ad-hoc; make sure when they hit it you have the conversation. You can give them 2-year grants or annual grant strategy. Depends on what you are willing to administer.
    26. Refresh programs are quite a way downstream. 250-300 employees you can’t do it ad-hoc anymore; you need to start making it a process. Purely from administration standup and fairness issue. 
    27. For 1st-10 employees - be thoughtful to the grant they originally got. But generally compare it to the market value at the time. Refresh is .25-.33 of a new hire grant since you will be getting it yearly. Companies don’t have institutional memory; you don’t know if people chose more cash/more equity, and you can’t use that going forward. That’s why you want a comp philosophy + standardization across the board.
5. Raises/promotions/etc. What are best practices for compensation changes?
    28. Two philosophies: promote into a role where you think you can succeed. The second is after they’ve succeeded.
    29. Typical promo is 10-15%. Typical both cash + equity. CA has strict laws about this; if they are at the same level as someone who just got hired you have to be able to explain why they are making different amounts. People could make a case. When you hire you get them at 50%th+
    30. Performance bonus: dont’ recommend an ad-hoc bonus plan in cash or equity. Becomes very political, especially if people hear about it. Then you have to explain it to people. You need to explain to people why their work is not meeting up. 
    31. Spot bonus: any kind of non-process bonus is problematic. Very quickly becomes ambiguity/discretion. 
    32. Don’t recommend spot/ad-hoc bonus. Tends to lean towards visibility which hurts other projects.
    33. If you have aggressive equity packages - **that is your bonus** - short-term recognition 
6. Sources of comparison data?
    34. “Pre-series B” data?
7. India hiring
    35. International - always get local data. Don’t try to use US data to normalize to India. It’s just not the same; social programs, perception of value, exchange controls… Radford is the #1 place for data in India. Only do it if you have 2-3 roles, or if we need only the software ladder, etc - be ready for the filters you need.
