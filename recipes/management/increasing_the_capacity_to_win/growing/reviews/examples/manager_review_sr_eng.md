# Overview

[EMPLOYEE] is **sometimes exceeding expectations **at [COMPANY]. He’s had an incredibly overloaded 2020 which has made
it hard for him to consistently do great work across the board. While he’s struggled to build great relationships,
understand his internal customers, and mentor his junior engineers, his company-level impact with the work on Schedule,
Budget, and Data Infrastructure has been critical to the success of [COMPANY]. In this review I’ll try to balance the
credit [EMPLOYEE] deserves for impact and technical strength with the areas he needs to grow in 2021 to truly hit his
stride as a manager and leader at [COMPANY]. I’m hopeful that with some step-change improvements to his leadership
skills [EMPLOYEE] will become an unstoppable force at this company. The step change needs to come from within.

What [EMPLOYEE] needs to do was captured most eloquently by one individual:

    I think [EMPLOYEE] has improved a lot in the last year. (...) We are working with humans, not just code. (...) He is a better person now. I hope next year he will be even better.

I understand the struggle [EMPLOYEE] is undergoing since I had a similar one about 5-6 years into my career. [EMPLOYEE]
’s incredibly sharp mind becomes his own worst enemy when his desire to get to the right answer quickly causes him to
interrupt, not listen, delegate poorly, and micromanage. For individuals like [EMPLOYEE] it becomes very, very difficult
to “cross the chasm” and learn to become a great manager. More frequently they stay on the IC path and smoothen out some
of the rough edges, leaning on individual contributions to have larger impact. [EMPLOYEE] needs to really think
carefully if he wants to de-emphasize that part of this skill-set at this point in his career.

The current plan is to have [EMPLOYEE] manage the Product Backend team. To succeed in this role he’s going to have to
become a master manager, delegator, communicator, talent magnet, and talent grower. In all of these areas he’s a novice
with some good ideas. Fortunately, he’s surrounded with people further advanced in their skills development in each
area. One way he can learn to listen and improve his relationships is by really starting to seek advice from his peers
and learn from them how they shine.

Finally, a wonderful quote from one of his teammates shows how people are rooting for [EMPLOYEE] to win in 2021:

    I think this year it’s really important for this team - we are hiring, we are shipping a lot on the products we are developing - this year will be very important. I hope he’s buckled up and ready :) I can see a lot of chaos can come, people without domain knowledge, I hope that gets handled well! I am observing this year more… This will be very important. Want to see how he handles it.

# Strengths

## Doing It Right

[EMPLOYEE]’s biggest strength is that he has a great technical mind and good knowledge of best practices. Across
different domains he’s able to contribute via execution or feedback. He has high standards and doesn’t shy away from
trying to raise the technical bar. He combines good ideas with a lot of code (e.g. with monorepo/doxlib/etc, or API
server) to make things real and not just ideas.

* Strength
    * I went through a draft spec review with him and he was really great in identifying the areas where he could
      identify more. That was a huge positive.
    * He’s clearly very good at switching context. I thought I was good at this until I worked with him :) What I find
      really valuable when PM resources were limited was his ability to think like a PM and have him fill out the
      less-than-complete PRDs we threw over.
    * Probably put him in the 4 area on execution. I think the scalability lens is slowing him down a little bit.
      Balance between executing “good” vs “great” - I think company policy is “don’t let great get in the way of good”
      and I think a slightly lower bar in Quality would let him execute faster. That said - he has seen shit products
      and knows what that happens.
    * Ability to attack a problem from different directions. Having the knowledge to attack it from different views.
      Looking at the problem not just from engineering but end-user, construction side of things. [example]
      Hierarchy-to-stages mapping, the stages defined, hierarchies defined. He has a complete understanding of why they
      are there.
    * He helped me fix my issues, has helped me through such scenarios many times.
    * Great technical contributions. Always add him in cross-functional code, see his code reviews for other people. He
      points out great problems. He was my go-to code reviewer in the API code and he gave great feedback. Good view on
      what is good API design.
    * He pushed me in technical discussions really well. He was convincible and helped me think in directions I wasn’t
      thinking in. I learn from him and come up with better solutions.
    * He has made a product that, at least from the backend side of things, is very modular. It doesn’t take much time
      to make changes. I use the clay that he’s made to mold it, fine-tune it.
    * Scales lens: I have noticed that he can plan things ahead and take steps so in the future things for me/him become
      easier. Especially with some of the refactoring he has done in last 2 months.

## Work Ethic & Execution

I totally agree with [EMPLOYEE]’s self-review that he learns quickly, works hard, and executes in the top % of engineers
at [COMPANY]. I’ve worked hands-on with [EMPLOYEE] and have seen the amount of code output he can do when he has focus
time. On other projects unrelated to engineering, like growing the Operations team, [EMPLOYEE] is incredibly fast at
finding solutions. He’s one of the few engineers I trust to execute on high-stakes, low-time projects like
the [CUSTOMER] Schedule launch or the [CUSTOMER] Azure launch. He’s executed projects across different groups of
people (like Project Mysore) successfully and is close-to-guaranteed to hit a deadline that he commits to.

Feedback

* Delivered sufficient quality/body of work to help [COMPANY] grow for the company: semblance of Data Infra, EAC out the
  door, Schedule out the door. Probably not good for him long-term - all of them are OK, not great quality. He can
  juggle many things and be a generalist.
* He definitely needs a vacation. Huge gap if he burns out.
* Biggest downside is he is in India timezone :) I wish he could “not-sleep” more than he does now… Work closer
  together. Would be huge value to have 24x7 [EMPLOYEE] development cycle.
* Leads numerous impactful projects end-to-end. He’s technically very capable. He has strong ownership, thinks of the
  work, breaks it down, and executes on it. Works with passion.
* I was impressed that [EMPLOYEE] did that so fast. Very impressed. Minor things like APIs are hard to QA but
  Sergey & [EMPLOYEE] are figuring that out between themselves.
* I feel pretty confident in his ability to execute. Very smart, super passionate, true to his commitments - very
  impressed with his nonchalant execution
* He does a ton of different things: CI, hiring, managing India… he is doing a good job and very hard job.
* Getting him to execute faster is like squeezing blood from stone. **If this was his only role - I wouldn’t be
  satisfied.**
* I see good communicatiion with CI team, but would like to get him more exposure in the company. I’m not sure everyone
  knows how much he is doing! He does touch a lot things, he has a lot of wisdom/experience for others to learn from -
  especially younger engineers in the US.

## Ownership

[EMPLOYEE] shows strong ownership at the Senior engineer level. From when he took on the Customer Insights team he’s
worked very closely with [PM], and now [PM], to build a working EAC and Schedule on top of DXDB. He’s worked across
large parts of [COMPANY]’s code base from doxlib to infra to customer-facing products and understands how most of it
ties together. He cares about impact and does his best to not finish until the project has had business results.

[EMPLOYEE] is not yet at my expectations of a Staff-level in terms of ownership. There are a few key things he needs to
improve on:

* Knowing what “done” is from a business perspective, ideally with metrics. One example was that I had to step in for FB
  Schedule launch to validate the weekly data going to [CUSTOMER]. As [EMPLOYEE] grows he should be able to tell that it’s
  not “done” until the customer is using it and push harder to discover blockers, even if they are outside Backend
  Engineering.
* Instill end-to-end ownership in his team. [ENG-IC] and [ENG-IC] are not able to think as Senior-level owners and often
  “finish” their work when it is incomplete. [EMPLOYEE] needs to show that he can grow them to the Senior level, ideally
  via inspiration and leading-by-example.
* See around corners: a Staff-level SWE will see problems before they appear and start providing solutions early. An
  example where [EMPLOYEE] could have contributed is in helping ProdOps get the “ground truth” they need to make their
  case on Schedule line items where we disagree with the GC. [EMPLOYEE] is the best individual to (a) realize this will
  be important and (b) understand all the technical possibilities at [COMPANY] that could be used to solve this problem.

Feedback

* He’d be a great role model for all the eng here. Just the way he handles things cooly. From office work to core
  engineering part of things. Jumping between issues. E.g. we get paged, need to fix things in Schedule report, he can
  handle that at the same time as other things.
* 100% he takes up projects, pulls people together, makes sure everything runs in harmony.
* OKRs and meetings are very helpful. We are aligned to the dream of the company. I think he is doing a great job there.
  The sprints - having goals is one of the main things for everyone, defining well, pooling ideas together - like Pull
  Planning with the subs!
* I think [EMPLOYEE] is very well aware of the job he needs to do. I have seen his work on Schedule, EAC - he is very
  dedicated to his job. On DI he makes sure we are on-track, following the JIRA board, on-deadline, etc. The things he
  owns he is doing very well.
* Whenever I have asked him about something, why was it done, why calculated this way - I got reasonable answers. Even
  though the EAC code was written in a hurry when I am working on it [EMPLOYEE] is the go-to person. There has never
  been a case where he has not been able to clear my doubts.

Improve

* I don’t really have an engineering partner for Schedule holistically. For me an end-to-end lead is someone who looks
  at both the FE and BE. They are able to piece it together and come up with all the Qs they have for both sides. They
  can talk to their team about estimates, milestones for all the areas. Right now, I need to have an in-depth convo with
  Sergey and then a quick convo with [EMPLOYEE] on BE. I don’t have in-depth convos with [EMPLOYEE].
* He shows his ownership in delivering end-to-end. But one thing he needs to improve - metrics to measure the impact.
  E.g. what [ENG-PEER] does - much more data oriented, metrics oriented. End-to-end data that shows real ownership of
  the problem.
* He didn’t do a good job in communicating with Mitul about what needed to be returned. If he had just gone to the Mode
  report and selected “All” he would have seen that - I had to point it out to him.
* He cares mostly about accuracy, automation - but he doesn’t seem as interested in the **customer visible parts of the
  product**. He couldn’t answer the questions about how much time was saved for ProdOps either. Somebody needs to get
  more involved there.

# Areas for Improvement

## Listening to peers/customers/reports

In many situations, even where [EMPLOYEE] does not have much experience or knowledge, he has a _strong idea in his head
about how things should be done_. He’s more focused on expressing his idea than he is at really listening and
understanding the people he is interacting with. I’ve personally experienced this in 1:1s and multiple meetings. This
feedback should not be a surprise since I’ve shared it before and just a few weeks ago I provided some very specific
techniques to try - but [EMPLOYEE] needs to take it much more seriously now. **His peers and reports are becoming
frustrated at how hard it is to collaborate with [EMPLOYEE]**, and that will limit his impact severely if not addressed.

The peer feedback was, in all cases, very direct and with emotion. People want [EMPLOYEE] to succeed but they’re tired
of the feeling of “fighting his opinions.” I’ve personally been in the same place as [EMPLOYEE] in my career and know
how hard it can be to “reach the other side.” The obvious “escape hatch” is for [EMPLOYEE] to claim “well I’m right” (
since he so often is!). The true test of leadership, however, is the _ability to bring people around to the truth_ -
whether it is yours or someone else’s! Just having the right opinion is maybe 20% of the work. And it all starts by
listening deeply.

As [EMPLOYEE] transitions into more of a management role he will sink or swim by his growth in this skillset. 2021 will
be a pivotal year.

Feedback

* He becomes opinionated very early. “You need to go and find out…” “You should do this…” It’s hard to have an open
  discussion with him; he is biased very early. He thinks he is teaching the person in front of him. Instead of
  listening. Room for open discussion is completely missing.
* DI communication has been poor. He hasn’t pushed Data Infra forward. The DC team has had to suggest improvements, or
  just do them ourselves. Communication isn’t “yes, we know, we don’t have resources to get to it.” Instead it is “we
  have that, go look at it” when we have already looked at it and it doesn’t do what we need.
* Needs to improve on his listening, with attention. [example?] when we talk he interrupts with questions. Many of the
  problems are solved if you just keep listening… empathize… when I was junior and there were managers that just
  listened - as I talked to him I figured out the solution.
* For sprint I wanted to put all the JIRA tickets into a single sprint. He moved all the tickets into his sprint without
  listening to my request. That removed all the estimates - work that me and XXX had done. I specifically told him not
  to do it, he ignored the message and moved it anyhow. Maybe he didn’t know we had points and it removed the estimates…
* I get the impression - maybe because [EMPLOYEE] built schedule - but I get the feeling that he rules out a lot of
  possibilities in his mind. For Schedule Tracking spec: we have a requirement to attach the screenshots. We have a lot
  of options, e.g. a screenshot ProdOps does manually, or automate it. We did that at Plangrid. I think [EMPLOYEE]
  immediately ruled that out in his mind. He wasn’t very opening to discussing that. Even the Retool app - “ProdOps
  should manually make this screenshot.” I don’t know if this is a real possibility but it would be nice to have more
  exploration. For new features we should automate from the get-go. Or ask ProdOps for what the options are.
* I would like to see more communication between ProdOps/[EMPLOYEE] - they can go back to him and see the things that
  need to be fixed. I keep seeing these bugs on external facing spreadsheet.
* I think AFI is when scale lens is necessary vs when it is not. I think sometimes where we’ve had conversations to
  “hack it together” - he pushes back on that, and sometimes there is value on moving more quickly even if not scalable.
  Starting to see that with Retool. Get initial testing & feedback even if not immediately scalable.
* To build the [COMPANY] API it is a manual process. Push the image, run a k8s command to redeploy, etc. As a result, if
  I’m doing development and I need to develop against them - I need to run the Python API. Everytime they make changes I
  need to pull everything down and do a bunch of work. It’s not convenient in terms of development. I would expect a
  development environment that I can just talk to and they keep updated. [did you talk to him?] **I told him but he said
  “just run the command, it is easy.”** He hasn’t made changes on his side. **It is not super-convenient in working with
  CI team**
* I’ve worked with everyone on the engineering team on some level. He is an exception, not in a positive sense, in
  communication. I haven’t felt this with anyone else at [COMPANY]. It’s very hard for everyone to talk to him and work
  effectively with him. (has heard this from other people on his team)

## Empathy

While “listening” is a particular skill [EMPLOYEE] needs to improve, Empathy is a core virtue that peers are concerned
about. The roughness of his listening skills contribute to this feeling but I think it is deeper. I’ve observed frequent
occasions where [EMPLOYEE] hasn’t been “people-smart” and really noticed the effect of his words on the people around
him. It seems like his mind is overly focused on the technical problems and misses out on other important clues. He
needs to train it to focus on some key empathy questions: “what does this person need? How can I help them?” in all
situations.

Feedback

* Not the first time this has happened. When I joined I didn’t feel like I was welcome. He cancelled all of the
  onboarding for CI team and I still haven’t done it - I watched the links to recording sessions.
* He’s always there with his thoughts on design, process, etc. He should find more time to mentor me and [ENG-IC] on
  infra design. Or on leadership, or technical sides. He should come up with some tasks for us that is not related to
  work. That will make [ENG-IC] & I be closer. Something of that sort is required.
* [EMPLOYEE] understands the problems, the challenges we have, but sometimes I feel like he’s not getting the situation
  I’m going through. He’s a very business-oriented person. He thinks ‘your work doesn’t matter, why are you doing it?’ -
  but sometimes we started the work because he asked us to!
* His communication feels like finger pointing. In a schedule meeting he talks about it like “I’m not getting anything
  from the Annotation side, you should go check what is broken…” Eventually we found it it wasn’t even an issue on the
  Annotation side but was on his side. His language made it sound to my team like he had done his research.
* What struck me is the team lunch - we are all chatting but he is checking his phone. This is the time where we need to
  spend building the relationships.
* It feels like he is passive aggressive.

Other views:

* Being patient with newcomers. Sometimes when you are new you start to pester people; he doesn’t get agitated. He’s
  always patient with everyone.
* For me, this has been a very good experience. I was facing a lot of difficulty understanding the calculations since I
  had no background in construction. He’s really helped me with that. Whenever I mess anything up his reaction is
  great - he points out how I can do.

## Team Management

This bucket is pretty broad and I’m listing it as the last area for improvement because some of it will be due
to [EMPLOYEE] being overloaded in 2020. When he has more time I see his leadership approach improve; he tends to skip
the mission-driven leadership when he gets very busy.

Feedback:

* I think he could be better at defining the mission. Getting a mission from CI team - “what is the mission?” - was like
  pulling teeth. Where do we add value? What is the end goal? I’d love to see tying that into the OKRs. Some of the OKRs
  are adjacent to the mission… Hard to see the impact. If OKR is not crushed, why not?
* Something CI teams lack is construction knowledge. Maybe providing them with personas, chapters from Construction
  Specifications Book - hierarchies based on that.
* he should say less “I” and more “we”. That definitely has an impact on the people in the room. Especially when people
  in the team - if he says “I came up with this design” it raises doubts in my mind. Not a major thing but I’ve seen
  this problem. He has to grow as a leader in the org, he should improve on this.
* Building informal relationships with his team members - so they are more cordial, friendly, so we can build a strong
  team.
* One good thing since [CUSTOMER] launch is no micromanagement, which used to be there. We observed that due to that our
  productivity went up :) we were able to make our own decisions. We had to deliver our milestones even if nobody helped
  us. Previously it was hard to keep up with his thoughts. In most recent 2 quarters he hasn’t had time - or he
  stopped - and our productivity shot up. Helped boost our confidence that we can make our own decisions.
* I haven’t been in any discussion where we are working longer term. (...) A lot of diving into the code, making changes
  and decisions… I can see [PM] thinking “this is Kaiser specific…” - I see [PM] touching on those points. I think it
  would be helpful, at this point, to get the bigger context. This is a good time - we have a legacy system, we’ve
  started working on hierarchy, good time to build the long-term view.
* Needs to work on fostering leadership on the team. E.g. [EMPLOYEE] told us “[ENG-IC], you talk to DC team, [ENG-IC]
  you talk to Annotation team.” But when I joined the team requirement gathering - I started off the first 5 minutes,
  then [EMPLOYEE] came in and hijacked the whole meeting. Definitely didn’t feel right for me. Was a low-point to me -
  he gave me a chance, I wanted to execute it. I feel like I learn more leadership qualities
  from [ENG-PEER], [MANAGER] - don’t have that much contact with them. Want to get more experience on this - how do you
  get the work done and keep people around the same table.
* Onboarding me there can be definite improvements on that front. Whenever I ask questions he has examples, and he can
  answer the question really well - he understands the customer need - but from the perspective of onboarding a new
  person I would say [EMPLOYEE] needs more push on the “here is the why” instead of having me figure it out. A bit more
  involvement from his side at this point given that the initial product is written.
* he is giving us time to figure things out by ourselves. But when we come to him with challenges it is usually not
  addressed.
* If we had more visibility into the roadmap, we would have started the building blocks earlier. Sometimes I feel like
  he has visibility but he is not open about it with the team.
* One primary reason I joined [COMPANY] was feedback after my 1st interview. I haven’t gotten that level of feedback
  from him - that’s the benchmark for me!! If I keep that as the baseline, there definitely is work required
  from [EMPLOYEE].

Some signs things are improving:

* I saw [EMPLOYEE] give [ENG-PEER] autonomy around the problem. He made it very clear what Zoning v2 was important,
  implication to Schedule product, why customers needed it. “You need to talk to Justin and [PM]” - take their customer
  requirements, developing TDD… He ran all that reasonably well. This felt more successful than the other stuff we’ve
  done.
* Career growth for reports: good to see he is thinking about that - I was worried about that, as team increases it will
  be difficult for him to do that.

# Performance Score

* Expectation of Role (role expectations for Engineering are [here]()): 4
* Contribution to Team: 3
* [COMPANY] Virtues: 3.9
    * Empathy: 4 - long way to 5.
        * _Sometimes yes, but being more open to different points of view - that could be a little bit better._
        * _I sense tension between [EMPLOYEE] & Sergey._
        * _Needs to improve his listening skills. Then he would feel more emphatic._
    * Ownership: 4 - see above.
        * I personally was not impressed by how much “fingerpointing” there was in his self-review; in the Areas for
          Improvement section he mostly pointed out how others could improve!
        * _hundred percent where the bar should be set. Owning CI team, Product, EAC has been very helpful._
        * _Lot of time he doesn’t take responsibility of his own failures. He is taking responsibility of his glory.
          When things fail he blames others._
    * Intellectual Honesty: 3 - don’t see hunger to have ideas challenged.
        * _He has end-to-end knowledge mostly, if he is not sure about certain things he will let you know._
        * _he starts from zero for many questions, not required often. It feels like you are dumb - he should ask more
          Qs, establish the ground for the discussion. Otherwise, most of the time he is logically correct. I would give
          him lower score (3?). He does become blunt sometimes - needs to consider someone else’s opinion, even if they
          are wrong. I have seen many people disappointed in meetings with [EMPLOYEE] where he is refusing their
          opinion._
        * _He asks questions, he listens to me when I have feedback. When I think things can be done better. He will
          evaluate it, make changes accordingly. He will say: “I don’t know” if he doesn’t know - I think that is
          important._
        * _The main challenge in communicating with [EMPLOYEE] is that he says one thing and does another. This is an
          integrity problem. When we feel we are on the same page, he then goes back and says this is not something he
          said. E.g. Marin’s case was a prime example: we had some difference of opinion, we finalized on a plan by end
          of Q1, I communicated it to him during 1:1. He had some candid feedback. Then suddenly in the OKR meeting he
          had a different perspective. Just the Wednesday before we had gone through it and he didn’t have any
          disagreement! He’s not bringing things up beforehand. _
    * Decisiveness: 5
        * _Being able to juggle different things. Making multiple decisions from different departments at the same
          time._
        * _he is quick and effective. I would rate him more than 5 :) Definitely he is fast, quick. Most of the time his
          decisions are technical - [EMPLOYEE] has been right to the point, correct most of the time._
        * _Quantification I could see the decisiveness: given his past experience, domain knowledge, he has been able to
          make decisions based on that. If I compare that to myself I can see I’m not comfortable yet. He can be more
          decisive and back it up with reason. He will never use authority - he will explain how he is thinking._
    * Humble - 3.5 - see the “need ego boost” behavior
        * _Humility is something that [EMPLOYEE] lacks sometimes. He always thinks that he is right. That is something
          that I don’t think is a good sign for his career growth, as a leader. There are people in the room who have
          their own experience, their own thoughts. Sometimes it is OK to accept “I was wrong.” This isn’t something
          I’ve seen from his side. When I think he is wrong, he never accepts it. It is OK to be wrong._
        * _I feel it is odd that he wrote he is doing work of 3-4 people - nobody can do that. Everyone at [COMPANY] is
          pushing their limits, stretching to contribute to the success. He shouldn’t be calling that out, boosts his
          ego a bit._
        * _Even if I work overtime I might say 2.5; he seriously believes he is doing so much more work. It’s hilarious
          he is saying this._
        * _Initially he wasn’t as good at it but I see him improved on the DI team, sharing more credits_
* Overall [COMPANY] Impact: 5
