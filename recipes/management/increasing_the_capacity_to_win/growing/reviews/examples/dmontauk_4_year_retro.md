WT asked me to write down some lessons from being Head of Engineering for the last 4.5 years. I‚Äôve collated my self-reviews from the last few years and a few other documents that do a good job of summarizing lessons learned, below. On top of those I‚Äôll add a few personal learnings that come to mind today.


# Areas I‚Äôve Grown


## The Rover Lesson

Several years ago, [CEO] gave me frank feedback that he couldn‚Äôt share certain information with me because I might ‚Äòlose my shit‚Äô. One example, back in late 2019, was the Founders‚Äô decision re: eliminating the rovers and moving to hand-held LIDAR. As they put it then, ‚Äòif we go down the rover path, we‚Äôll go bankrupt before we solve the tech. While we don‚Äôt know how to pull off hand-held LIDAR, we have to figure it out.‚Äô I was livid about the decision and how engineering was expected to deliver a hail Mary tech transition with no consultation with me ahead of time and made my displeasure clear. 

Eliminating rovers was, with 20/20 hindsight, obviously the right decision. There‚Äôs no point in walking down a path that ends in a cliff. I learned two things from that episode, although it took several years for the lessons to fully sink in:



1. **Passion can be scary**. I was so excited to build hardware! I believed my team could deliver! I wanted to take on the challenge! All of these can be very positive emotions‚Ä¶ but when you may need to shoot Rover, the emotional attachment becomes a liability. My founders needed a cold, calculating, level-headed Head of Engineering at that moment. Instead, they got the ‚Äòfront of the room, rah-rah, passionate, visionary‚Äô Head of Engineering. 
2. **_Everything_** at a startup flows backward from ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go bankrupt.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt matter that we had a technical roadmap ready for Rovers, or that we‚Äôd bought parts and hired people. All of that was sunk cost. It made no sense to ‚Äòhedge our bets‚Äô by working on Rovers while doing handheld LIDAR, since Rovers were a dead-end anyhow. I was thinking locally in terms of engineering execution. I had to learn to think globally, in terms of **company** execution.


## Emotional Regulation

Passion is great! Dispassion is great too. Emotional Regulation, i.e. being able to control _how _I react in a given moment, is critical in a Head of Engineering role. It‚Äôs critical because it massively _slows down the business_ if other executives have to be careful about what information they share, when they share it, and how they share it. If I‚Äôm not passionate and inspirational in the moments where I really can be, it massively _slows down the business_, because my team won‚Äôt feel motivated to go conquer mountains. Emotions don‚Äôt need to be controlled, of course, but they should be observed, understood, and _channeled_. This is the hardest part of growing as a leader, in my experience. It‚Äôs so hard, and so important, that I had this at the top of my daily notes doc I check:



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


I don‚Äôt think of emotional regulation as _tamping down_ on emotions. That would be repressing them and actually be worse; I see it more as really observing emotions and understanding where they are coming from. Sometimes, those emotions reflect something very important that should be amplified (e.g. excitement!!). Sometimes, the emotions come from a place of fear and my assumptions need to be checked (e.g. that eng is expected to do something impossible). Emotional regulation is about running a feedback loop between emotions/reflection/behaviors instead of accepting them as-is.


## One Number To Rule Them All

It‚Äôs hard to overstate how important that one number is at startups: cash in the bank. It‚Äôs actually kind of neat what a simple loss function startups have. Sure, it‚Äôs scary too ‚Äì but let‚Äôs remember that we‚Äôll all be fine even if our company fails (nobody here is going hungry‚Ä¶). So let‚Äôs harness The Number instead of fearing The Number. 

**I believe it‚Äôs our greatest moral responsibility to give back to the world more than we took from it. **Am I helping or hindering the world? The bigger the company the murkier the answer becomes. At startups the answer is strikingly clear: earned vs burned. Either people get value from our product, and choose to pay us for it, or they do not. Our ability to generate more value than we consume getting there literally decides if we deserve to exist as an organization. The system will ultimately self-correct (The Number becomes zero!) and we have tons of opportunities to correct before then (get The Number higher!). There is some beauty in that.

Why am I adding this in ‚Äòareas I‚Äôve grown?‚Äô I‚Äôve always valued First Principles Thinking, Working Backwards, etc. But believing it's important, and actually doing it, are two different things. When I joined [COMPANY] I had things more important to me than the business. Ego-driven things, like the size of my engineering team, mattered more to me. Or the coolness of the technology we were building. Or doing the ‚Äòfun‚Äô things rather than the ‚Äònecessary‚Äô things. And while those still matter to me, I think I‚Äôve reoriented myself mostly towards ‚Äúwhat does the business need?‚Äù question. I think this mindset shift may have been the key unlock to really feel like an executive and not just a manager. It sounds easy, but it took me several years.


## People & Organizations are Resilient

I regret not having fired some of the early engineering team faster. I regret not having given hard feedback to some individuals sooner. I regret not having canceled or reoriented some projects sooner. I regret not having reorganized the teams/reporting structures in the past faster. Reflecting on a lot of delayed decisions, I realized I was afraid to do them because I fundamentally didn‚Äôt believe people & the organization were resilient. That they would be OK. 

They almost always are.

I understand this much better now, and I feel MUCH more comfortable asking for hard things than I did 4 years ago. I think (and would love feedback) that this has helped me give more direct feedback in the last year than I did before. I think I still have a way to go here; I see others much better at this than I ([PEER], [CEO]).  I can continue to work on saying what I believe is true, saying what I‚Äôm going to do and when, saying what I‚Äôm doing, and saying what I did. People & organizations are resilient and can handle it.


## Working with CEO & Executives

I have an engineering leadership peer group I‚Äôm part of, and a few months ago we were ~~griping~~ reflecting on how different Head of Engineering roles are from other engineering roles. One of them said it best: ‚Äúit‚Äôs very lonely.‚Äù One of the biggest differences between an exec role and every other role is _you have nobody else who can do your job ‚Äì and thus **really** help you!_ Sure, [PEER], [CEO], and [PEER] are all incredible mentors and have helped me through some of the tougher problems. But none of them have ever run engineering! I had to filter all the advice through the ‚Äúbut will it work in engineering?‚Äù lens. I often also got advice from other engineering leaders, outside of [COMPANY]. But none of them knew our unique culture and situation! I had to filter _their_ advice through the ‚Äúbut will it work at [COMPANY]?‚Äù lens. 

Ultimately, there was no one to pass the buck to. 

It‚Äôs kinda scary to realize that. 

This realization changed how I worked with [CEO], [PEER], and [PEER]. It prompted me to have an additional level of empathy because they probably felt the same way. It reminded me that I should avoid burdening them with problems because, they too, had no one else to turn to. It generated within me an additional desire to support, to problem solve, to create a team spirit. Because it wasn‚Äôt the kind of team I used to be part of, a team of actual peers that could step in and do my job. Those were simpler days. I miss the comfortable feeling of support when surrounded by strong engineers. I even miss the tacit rivalry and the (occasional ;) griping about upper management. But I miss it the way I miss my childhood, with a knowledge that not only I can never go back, I wouldn‚Äôt go back if I could‚Ä¶ that phase of my life is over.

I‚Äôve learned that becoming an executive is, in a way, another ‚Äúlevel‚Äù of growing up. It‚Äôs a stiffer dedication, a more extreme ownership, a broader definition of responsibility. To work with executives and for a CEO, you must _grow into_ the role. Until you do, the others look at you like you would look at a child, but not with pity or with annoyance‚Ä¶ with that patient understanding, and gentle support, because they also had to grow up. They understand the journey.

Five years ago I was sitting at Wade‚Äôs backyard firepit trying to find inner strength. I wasn‚Äôt sure I could ever succeed in this job. Wade and his neighbor (and several-time founder) looked at each other and, nodding, claimed I would have to do ‚ÄúThe Work‚Äù. It sounded mysterious and I wasn‚Äôt really sure what they meant. 

I think I understand it now. 


# Areas I Haven‚Äôt Grown (But Wish I Did)

Aka regrets üôÇ


## Customer-Centric Culture

Our customers are faceless to me. 

Happy customers are the #1 thing [COMPANY] needs to win next year. If we just get massive expansions with our current customer set we‚Äôd be on-track to be a $1B company. And yet‚Ä¶ if you ask me the names of individuals using our product at [CUSTOMERS], I wouldn‚Äôt be able to answer that. If you ask me about their top problems I‚Äôd guess it has to do with site performance and data accuracy ‚Äì but those are generic answers, not informed by having my finger on the pulse. And if I don‚Äôt feel the pain of our customers in my bones, then why would the rest of engineering feel it in their bones?

I tried setting up metrics on product usage, but our product isn‚Äôt designed to have lots of users such that metrics capture the pain. I tried setting up recordings of product usage but getting good signal-to-noise was impossible. Same with Gong calls; I‚Äôve watched dozens of hours of them but gave up after a while. I‚Äôve brainstormed with Jesse and [PEER] about this many times, but they‚Äôve got lots of fires on their plates. In a remote-first company where Customer Success is always ‚Äòfar away‚Äô, on a product that we engineers not only cannot use ‚Äì we can‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs ‚Äòworking‚Äô ‚Äì it‚Äôs been very, very hard to make customer pain personal. 

Why is this so important? It‚Äôs an opportunity for ‚Äòpositive pressure‚Äô. Sure, we can continue to have Moffet file P0 bugs, or [PEER] press on the importance of polish, but all of that feels like _work_. Helping flesh & blood people, people you‚Äôve met and know will smile at you next time you visit because they love the widget thing you added to the print page when they use it every day, feels _impactful_. Call me old-fashioned: startups should have that level of engineering/customer engagement. It‚Äôs one of our competitive advantages against the big co‚Äôs.

And we‚Äôre not using it.


## More #GSD 

When I look at how much our product has evolved over the last year it‚Äôs a bit disappointing. 

If we look at the 20XX engineering roadmap we still have a _ton _of features we were considering almost X years ago that we haven‚Äôt shipped. There‚Äôs definitely room for our Product/Design/Eng team to improve going forward. This will require constant tweaking of process/people/culture, something I didn‚Äôt have a lot of patience for (WT will do much better). Examples of what I think can happen better:



* **Finishing things**. E.g. [REDACTED] view. We had lots of ideas that were 90% done and could have probably been launched without a lot more work. We‚Äôre not good at clearly communicating with Product where we should be working on a P2, despite having some P1s, because the P2 will provide some business value quickly.
* **Iterative launching**. We still, after all these years and all these discussions, chew off way too much. [REDACTED] are recent examples. Figuring out some way to really ship something incremental every 2 weeks to _customers_ will help our velocity and culture and morale.
* **Pay off the right tech debt.** This is more of a hunch based on my time on #need-for-speed and #data-is-not-beta. There are parts of our tech stack that simply ‚Äòpatching‚Äô to get the right behavior may be more work than fixing/rebuilding the reasons why they aren‚Äôt working in the first place. 
* **Do things right ‚Äì the first time**: see the next section


## More #R

There are parts of our engineering culture that lack the necessary rigor: our code review culture (too much rubber stamping), our testing culture (not enough behavior testing in the most critical parts of our product), our QA culture (too much throwing things over the wall), our PRD culture (not enough details and edge cases thought-through). Historically, I tried to get folks to step up to own these problems. I don‚Äôt think that worked very well, and I‚Äôm wondering if I should have imposed more specific standards/behaviors. Results need to speak for themselves, and my ‚Äòvacuum leadership‚Äô approach here, while conscious, was not effective. A different approach may be warranted in 2024.

This rigor could significantly speed up engineering, if applied right. I‚Äôve seen a ton of re-work happening over the last few months. It‚Äôs way too expensive for a startup engineering team to build the same thing multiple times. 



# 2021 thoughts about [COMPANY]‚Äôs Culture (shared with my coach)

I joined a startup because I wanted a chance to create my own engineering culture. I‚Äôve always had a backseat, at Google, Twitter, and TellApart, and rather enjoyed critiquing the culture that had emerged. It was a safe place to critique from :) At Twitter I went a step further and tried to influence a culture I considered problematic by creating a leadership course that taught engineers to lead bottoms-up instead of ‚Äúshaking their fist at the sky.‚Äù There were limits to how much I could change in a 3000 person company of course and I was cognizant of that. [COMPANY] is a chance for me to shape it with almost no limits.

When I was evaluating companies I looked for founders that were intellectually honest, curious, not assholes, empathetic to others, and hungry. Those were some of the cultural values I found important and wanted to make sure I was aligned with leadership. I felt like I found those foundations with [CTO] and [CEO] and could build a more unique engineering culture on top of them. Over the last two years I wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of culture we needed - to me it feels like it needs to fit the problem the company is facing ideally, so culture accelerates the company. There is a lot of ambiguity in creating a new product in a new space. We‚Äôve pivoted several times and thus, naturally, people who thrive in ambiguity and can define a path forward have done better. I‚Äôve explicitly started hiring for those traits and I‚Äôd consider that a defining cultural trait now: providing people with problems, not direction, and trusting that they solve them. I asked a recent new manager how he would describe our culture and he used the words ‚Äúfaith, trust, confidence. Trust that goals will be exceeded by having confidence people will execute.‚Äù He did mention it was a double-edged sword and would make it hard to scale up.

I reflected on this and found another piece of myself that might be influencing how I lead. Throughout my career I‚Äôve personally chafed under the ‚Äútoo much process or rules‚Äù regimes and have hungered to understand the bigger picture and how I fit into it. I‚Äôve always wished that people would just give me big problems to solve and trust me to figure out how to solve them. I don‚Äôt want to accidentally become ‚Äúthe Man‚Äù that others rail against and so I shy away from defining the rules and prefer to focus on the goals and understanding them. I create my culture by always asking tough questions, to get people to think bigger until they understand what needs to be done, and then I trust that they will find the best ways to solve it. This approach goes from our interview process (where I ask a lot of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions) to our onboarding (where engineers are exposed to the entire [COMPANY] end-to-end product in the first 30 days) to our OKR review process (where I encourage updating goals based on what people have learned).

Over the years I have noticed that this approach may be too ambiguous for some individuals. It used to bother me a lot when people didn‚Äôt enjoy the ambiguity or weren‚Äôt able to navigate through it but now I‚Äôm realizing different personalities or developmental levels simply have different abilities to deal with it. To many, a stricter top-down approach helps them move faster and I‚Äôve learned to provide it (albeit usually a bit late). This probably leads to a feeling in the organization that the culture is chaotic or disorganized. I‚Äôm OK with that feeling as long as it doesn‚Äôt consume the org and slow down delivery too much, or when it becomes too stressful and people are trying to figure out **what** they should be doing instead of having fun doing it. I don‚Äôt know yet how to ‚Äúread the room‚Äù (especially in a remote-first environment) to know if I‚Äôm walking the balance right.

There are parts of our culture that I‚Äôm worried about and would like to improve over the next six months. I don‚Äôt think we are ‚Äúfun‚Äù or that people enjoy their relationships as much as possible; we are too transactional. I don‚Äôt think we celebrate rewards and I‚Äôm worried people are shy about their failures, leading to less risk-taking. And almost most of all, I‚Äôm worried engineers will shake their fist at me about a ‚Äúnot-great‚Äù culture, instead of coming to me and giving me the chance to improve things.
