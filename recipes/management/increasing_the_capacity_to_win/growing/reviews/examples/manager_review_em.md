# Overview

[EMPLOYEE] is **sometimes exceeding expectations **as an Engineering Manager at [COMPANY]. He’s become super strong at
leading a team in execution (“winning”) and has started showing signs that he can hire and grow engineers as well (
“increase capacity to win”). He’s vastly improved in being metrics-driven, as seen in peer feedback, and has started
meeting my expectations on impact vs activity focus. His excellent end-to-end understanding of the business and (most)
of the technology (at a higher level) is serving him well: he’s the go-to person for PM and for me to think through
threading features end-to-end. His strong empathy and servant leadership skills are also serving him well: people love
interacting with him and he’s become a force multiplier by tying efforts across the company together.

[EMPLOYEE] has been managing the Annotation team for about a year so his performance at this stage is slightly ahead of
a median manager. To **exceed expectations **in the next 6 months [EMPLOYEE] needs to accomplish the following:

1. Turn the team into a predictable “improvement machine.” On the tooling side the Annotation team is very close to
   having great metrics and a backlog of improvements that causally drive down annotation cost. On the automation side
   the story is still more uncertain; with the additional headcount, [EMPLOYEE] needs to show he can deliver on some of
   the good ideas (CG, DG, ML, other…) and build a “turn the crank” improvement machine.
2. Remove the team dependency on [EMPLOYEE]. Feedback shows that when [EMPLOYEE] is not around the level of execution
   and customer understanding drops significantly. He needs to either build a self-managing culture or groom a senior
   engineer to provide a lot more team leadership.
3. Land some rockstar talent - without [MANAGER]’s help. [EMPLOYEE] needs to show that he can build teams independently
   and retain/grow talent internally. He’s proven he can do this with junior/mid-level talent so the next step is 1-2
   Senior+ engineers.

Since [EMPLOYEE] is incredibly growth oriented there is a very strong likelihood that he can excel in the next 6 months
and grow into a Sr. Manager soon, as well as be on a path to a Director-level role if [COMPANY] keeps growing. The main
question I really have is “does he want it?” [EMPLOYEE] seems confused about exactly the career path he should choose.
His actions show a lot of interest in the management side (e.g. in 1:1s we almost always dive into people issues,
management skill improvements, etc) but his words are looking towards technical depth (“Some day, I would like to see
myself as ML Architect who can use ML to optimally solve business-critical problems effectively.”). [EMPLOYEE] needs to
resolve this split soon so he can commit for 1+ year to a particular path and unblock some other org-level decisions.

This review focuses on the management side of [EMPLOYEE]’s competencies because he really shines there. If I was to
evaluate [EMPLOYEE] on the technical side I’d rate him as a strong Feature Lead but a weak Technical Lead. This is
pretty common for someone who is as impact-driven as [EMPLOYEE]. He’s shown numerous times that he can pull together
technology to hit business goals; however, his technical depth/skills in the particular areas [COMPANY] needs (data
pipelines, realtime serving systems, ML infrastructure, perception, etc) are not Staff-level. If [EMPLOYEE] wants to
really dive deep into ML and become an “architect” (depth) he’d have to prepare for ~2 years of hardcore technical
learning and the cost associated with that. If [EMPLOYEE] wants to stay on the “product engineering” path, with a solid
background in ML and how to use it in products, he’d be performing at Staff-level today (lower end). In either role I’d
expect he’d provide less value to his team and [COMPANY] than as a technically-oriented Engineering Manager.

The good news is [EMPLOYEE] has options, since [COMPANY] needs all of the above. The bad news is [EMPLOYEE] needs to
build that internal compass that directs him - he seems overly swayed by outside opinions instead of using them as
inputs into his own prioritization framework (this is also visible in other parts of his work and can be seen in peer
feedback). [EMPLOYEE] should think deeply about this and then work with me to develop that compass.

Finally, a quote from one of his reports which really captures him well:

“Generally [EMPLOYEE] is an excellent engineering manager. Very metrics driven, great people skills. Puts a lot of
thought into tracking things, focused on stability of the production pipeline - maybe the highest priority for us - and
he makes sure everything we are doing is oriented towards that end.”

# Strengths

## Execution Leadership

[EMPLOYEE] shines as an execution-focused leader. He builds clarity, a reasonable amount of process (which he
experiments with regularly and tweaks!), a metrics-driven approach, and honest self-reflection on success/failures. He’s
the strongest execution-focused leader we have at the company at this moment.

Feedback

* I have never seen such an organized manager in my life!! He does a very good backlog grooming, he talks
  to [OPS-IC], [PM] [OPS-IC] to prioritize them. We come up with OKRs and have clear goals. Very much written down.
  Great at KPIs, breaking down tasks… easier to track progress. What I like is most decisions are done in the team. We
  do have more team meetings but most of them are together, everyone is aware of them.
* What are the main focuses? What projects do we push back? This clarity helped all of us know what we are doing, what's
  expected from us. The way he organizes it helps us - probably through the planning. The objectives were clear, what we
  want to do and why we want to do it. Breaking it down into pieces and finding the problems in the Annotation piece.
  When we spend time on each problem, e.g. the ordering issue. It took us a quarter to fix all the bugs! Prioritizing
  those was important.
* Super organized. It’s very clear to me that he wants to be a manager, team lead, keep everyone on-target.
* Hard team to run. Has a mix of ML, automation, manual work… Hard to have a clear mission. Without proper leadership it
  would be easy to get frustrated, and [EMPLOYEE] managed to avoid this.
* Annotation team is in a very different position today then when he started taking the lead. That impact is
  super-important.
* I think he has a good way of realizing what projects have higher priorities. How much he can push himself and everyone
  else on the team to finish things on time. And he knows when to push back - I really like that about him. I feel like
  he has transformed the Annotation team, the way I work. I’m really happy!
* He is very process-oriented, example is his OKR structure. It’s much better than what I do. He puts in good process.
* I think he does well in setting up the process, making sure dependencies are working. He’s experimented with the
  process and made improvements in standup, oncall. From the POV of organizing the work being done, and the people who
  are doing it, I think he is doing very well.

## End-to-End Understanding

[EMPLOYEE] understands everything from the business down to each team level better than anyone else at the company. He’s
benefited from managing the D.C. team, building PEACE, creating the Encyclopedia, being involved in ML, and now running
the Annotation team. His knowledge is invaluable and I’m purposefully grooming him to be our “big-picture Feature Lead”
for the most important end-to-end projects.

Feedback

* Wide view of things at the company. Has seen EAC, DC, Annotation, he’s targeted some of the easy/simplifying
  solutions.
* One of my favorite engineers. Good mix of customer understanding, eng understanding, seeing the whole picture. He’s
  the guy I go to to make sure I’m not way off-base. A lot of that happened with Construction Ency. I needed someone
  thinking from Eng perspective to know the whole workflow.
* If I say something, explain something to him, an idea or an issue - he gets it right away. Other people I need to
  break it down, explain it a couple of times. [EMPLOYEE] knows where I’m going without finishing the sentence! I really
  appreciate that in working with him. A lot of people appreciate that about him. He understands both sides.
* Agree with his “understand customers” strength. Also with communicating across the company - [OPS-IC], PMs - our work
  is well aligned.

## Empathy → Mentorship

I’m tying Empathy and Mentorship together because [EMPLOYEE] comes from a place of deep caring about his people and his
peers. He’s always listening and he provides mentorship almost through osmosis - it’s just “who he is.” A lot of
individuals want to become mentors as a goal, or a step in their career; for [EMPLOYEE] it comes naturally. This is the
most valuable type of senior technical leadership we can hope for. It can almost never be taught.

Feedback

* Probably the nicest person at the company. Whenever there is tension he helps defuse it. One of the people who makes
  it enjoyable to come to work and do the fun stuff.
* I think he is a fantastic person in general, a great manager, managing the team really well.
* He’s doing really well - I compare myself to 6-7 months ago and I think I improved significantly. He’s present,
  supporting when needed. He wants to make sure everything has the correct design, architecture…
* “whenever you fail, it is my failure. Whenever you succeed, it is my success.” He cares about the people on the team.
* Leadership skills. He really pushes for the team to solve the problem. He can do it himself - but he wants to see
  other people doing it. If something is dragging on he will interject. But he always gives the perfect amount of time
  to come up with the answer. I really appreciate that about him.
* He’s a great mentor. I’ve learned a lot by watching him, he’s given me a lot of great advice. I can tell him anything
  and I can trust him, and get great advice. He doesn’t judge me, he takes it honestly.
* Good communication skills and cohesiveness. Respectful of others.
* He helps whenever team needs help. Helped me with onboarding DAG, helped [DIRECT-REPORT] - figures out where help is
  needed and does it.

# Areas for Improvement

## Customer Obsession

[EMPLOYEE] is actually obsessed about customers and impact. But his team is not. As the manager, he needs to be judged
by his whole team as well, and this is an area where he needs to coach, train, or hire to build that muscle. Whenever I
interact with [DIRECT-REPORT], [DIRECT-REPORT], or [DIRECT-REPORT] I’m disappointed about how well they understand their
internal customers (Annotators) as well as external customers. It’s been improving slightly but there is a long way to
go. [EMPLOYEE] needs to find the right process, rituals, or communication structure to nudge his team in the right
direction.

Feedback

* I don’t want to be in all the meetings - e.g. with MARS annotation I need more information. Internal sessions with the
  group would be useful. Familiarize with product team, I want to know more about what they do. But I’m not expose to
  them.
* There could be more time spent on that. [EMPLOYEE] knows everywhere, DC team, where data comes from, where it goes. He
  knows what the product wants. I don’t think the rest of the team knows what Product wants, or ProdOps wants.
* He benefits in being in meetings with [OPS-IC] etc. The rest of the engineers don’t see that. Perhaps they should get
  more exposure.
* I had to follow up with him. It had to be C.I. driven. Annotation is not considering us as customers, more treating
  Product/ProductOps as customers. He should be thinking all of CI as customers.
* Being proactive about Annotation quality - even now there is no clear roadmap or process for verifying the quality of
  annotations. CI has to figure out the issues - problems with our projections - and we file the bugs. Then they solve
  them. No proactive work - no guarantee on quality of the annotations.

Other perspective:

* He is very good at this. He really makes sure everything we are doing is tightly aligned with the needs of the
  customers.

## Engineering Depth

I’ve summarized a lot of this feedback above.

Feedback

* I read he wants to be an ML architect - I don’t see him doing the things to enable that. There is a dichotomy. I don’t
  see him having the discussions to learn the ins & outs of learning production ML, to become a master of that. Maybe he
  is attracted to sexy things? Maybe he hasn’t been exposed to it, to people who have been exposed, so he doesn’t know
  which path to walk? If that’s the case, he needs to go out and find teachers that he would benefit from. I don’t
  think [COMPANY] has the knowledge resources or power to make it happen. He needs to do it himself.
* Haven’t really seen him doing many of the things I expect a TL to do. Don’t see him bringing new ideas in how we
  develop code, how we architect things. A lot of ideas have come from other teams - e.g. local testing, integration
  testing from D.C. team. Even code formatting. This is not originating with [EMPLOYEE]. Not seeing him growing the
  skills of the team in this regard either. Maybe because he has been very focused on hiring and not code reviews.
* I think he is a good engineer - I don’t think he is a great engineer. He needs to commit to either management or
  technical leadership. E.g. his infra setup was not generally reusable, in the D.C. codebase.
* I think he would be a much better manager than like a Staff engineer. It would take him a long time to get to Staff
  and have the expertise - at [COMPANY] things - that would be required for a Staff engineer. But I think he would be
  really good at organizing even ~40 engineers, training them, keeping them focused.
* Was hoping he would be more focused on the technical sides, specifically on scale and looking at more aspects of the
  problem. He punts problems to “next time” too quickly. Scale and technical challenges don’t seem to be his first
  priority.
* Around D.I. and annotation - requirements are not very clear. Seems to be day-to-day requirements and not long-term
  thinking, especially on the infra side. For a senior person, thinking about the long-term, they should know what their
  dependencies are. D.I. should be taking care of their dependencies but I don’t see them coming with those
  requirements. Too much about “what we need now” and not “what we’ll need eventually.”
* I feel like I know more about the technologies at [COMPANY]. We need new ways of doing things… we should try to
  introduce new things, like DataFlow. It’s his responsibility, the team’s responsibility to do new things. Otherwise we
  will feel we are doing the same things and get bored.
* I really don’t know [if he has technical depth] - I think he has but he needs time? I think he could do that given
  time.
* From what I can tell from historical development of the code I don’t see the velocity I’d like to see - velocity of
  development. Stuff has not evolved in the annotation pipeline as quickly as it should. I don’t see a lot of thinking
  about tech-debt. Things are fine when one person owns them, architecturally, but will become a problem when multiple
  people are working on it.
* Some of this criticism is targeted at the handoff of the Annotation pipeline from [MANAGER] to the team. People don’t
  get the principles that were started. I expected a Tech Lead to be interested in the problem - the problem is
  interesting! - and he should get the team excited.
* I think [MANAGER] left a gap in engineering culture when he started doing other work and it hasn’t been filled.

## Delegating & Higher-level Work

Adding this in case he wants to stay on the management path. [EMPLOYEE] has gotten quite good at delegating more
junior/mid-level work and now needs to build a bench of senior people below him so he can focus on higher-level work.

Feedback

* What would [EMPLOYEE] need to replace [MANAGER]? Improve his skills in hiring, team management. Get more experience in
  front of customers - translating their conversations into needs & requirements.
* He needs to spend more time being the leader - always being at the meetings. Sometimes he’s busy, interviewing, doing
  other things. It’s very important to have him there because he’s the only one who can connect the problems. We rely on
  him a lot. He’s trying to train [DIRECT-REPORT], his team to grow and work together without him. Not a huge pain but
  things are noticeably more effective when he is around.
* Haven’t had much here [career discussions]. What I want, what my weaknesses are… I think the career discussion we need
  to have more. Maybe I need to start that. He said he is looking for me to drive projects end-to-end but I think I need
  more career discussion with him.

# Performance score

* Expectation of Role (role expectations for Engineering are [here](); we don’t have written expectations for Managers):
  **4**
* Contribution to Team: **4**
* Demonstration of Company Virtues: **4.4**
    * “I look to [EMPLOYEE] for the Virtues! He rated himself 4 everywhere, I like that - but I think he is a 5 across
      the board.”
    * Ownership: 4
        * he hits his commitments (historical annotation)
        * he measures himself, he is very data-oriented person. “I am done” -- he asks for the data :) he drives the
          projects end-to-end, checks the status of the project, and makes sure to get the data.
    * Humble: 5
        * works largely in the background, tries to give the credit to the person, even though he helped them many times
    * Decisiveness: 5 on Feature Lead, 3 for Technical Lead,
        * seems to go to DB often
        * some of the ones he made were very good - sometimes I wasn’t sure, e.g. not training the ML model. We didn’t
          contribute to ML in Q4 before [PEER] joined! But I think they were the right decisions
    * Empathy: 5
        * he has the listening skill. Listens with attention, lets people complete their thoughts.
    * Intellectual Honesty: 5 in some cases, 3 in others (largely technical)
        * asks lots of good questions - but what about himself? Not sure he knows his own technical abilities. Asking
          the questions to himself.
        * he has not given me any improvements I can make.
        * He is able to ask questions when someone is not meeting deadlines…
        * I often don’t get satisfactory answers. E.g. how we handle deployments, we put tags on images. We tag specific
          git branch names and double-PRs. Second PR to bump the image. I don’t like it at all and it seems
          like [EMPLOYEE] strongly prefers it but isn’t justifying it. Bumps the conversation a week later. We end up in
          “agree to disagree” places. I suspect he doesn’t want to change things [MANAGER] did - but I can’t really say,
          conversations don’t resolve clearly.
* Overall [COMPANY] Impact:** 4**
