# Responsibilities & Projects


## Project #1: All of Engineering

**Responsibility/description**

As Head of Engineering my main responsibility is to ensure that our team is working on the _right_ priorities, delivering _reliably_ and _quickly _in the short term, and placing the right bets to have a long-term _technical competitive advantage_.

I believe what the Engineering team has delivered in the last 12 months to be the best work we’ve ever done. The major launches include:

[REDACTED]
**Your contribution**



1. Betting on the right people. All of these projects were driven and staffed by [COMPANY] engineers; there were a few inflection points where my decisions were key. A few examples include betting on [EMPLOYEE] to build WIP on top of meshes, on [EMPLOYEE] to build Factory Annotation, on [EMPLOYEE] + [EMPLOYEE] + [EMPLOYEE] to increase our Data Capture reliability, and on [EMPLOYEE] to own the Progress team and drive all those product launches. 
2. Building a very effective Product/Engineering relationship and process. I’ve worked very closely with [PEER] and the other PMs to ensure that Product/Design/Engineering collaborate well, negotiating scope/timeline/quality regularly, and having empathy for challenges on each side. We’ve been agile with our process, using Cycles when predictive delivery was key and switching to more self-managing teams as the situation warranted. 
3. Shifting the culture to a data-driven one. As [COMPANY] has scaled to 12+ sites scanned per week, our previous approaches for understanding what was happening from Reality Capture all the way to WIP were falling apart. I personally built our first set of RC + Annotation dashboards and have iterated weekly with the teams on them, using process + stories + impact to change how decisions are made at [COMPANY]. 

**Impact**

Critical. Example is helping the Factory Annotation team increase the % of work processed from single-digits to >XX%. 

**Areas for Improvement**



1. I was late to helping some teams that needed my help, and this delayed work by several months. The Factory Annotation team was very dependent on changes on the Operations side and they did not have the tools to effect them; once I stepped in we were able to accelerate deployment of FA significantly. I should have detected this several months earlier instead of waiting to see if the team could pull it off.
2. I could also have detected earlier that the team needed my help in building out a metrics culture. I pushed various individuals for 2-3 months hoping to find someone who could drive it, and in the end had to drive it myself. It might have saved us a big chunk of time if I had started by driving it and then found an individual to take it over from me. 


# #1 Strength

_What do you think you’re particularly strong at - perhaps better than 90% of peers (people with a similar amount of experience, at [COMPANY] and elsewhere)? Pick **ONE** and write a paragraph describing the strength. Then, include 3-5 examples of how this strength was key to your successes over this review period._

Unranked: 



* Seeing both the big picture and the details.
* Curiosity → learning quickly. Even when I’m not an expert (e.g. WebGL, vSLAM, etc) I can come up to speed and make decisions effectively.
* Ability to ruthlessly cut scope?
* Communicating with the business about technical tradeoffs.
* Executive presence: I’ve improved a lot at keeping my cool, negotiating effectively with [CEO] + [PEER], putting the business first.
* Operations know-how: having managed the team + been in ops myself, I understand how they work and can translate between Eng & back.
* Process creation: I think I do a good job of “not too much” and “not too little” process.
* Getting things started: WIP-to-Photos, metrics dashboards, Hotspots, FA - I place a lot of good bets on completely new things.
* Coaching & upleveling: I think I’ve provided value to my reports and helped them improve.

# #1 Area for Improvement

Based on the examples above, I think I need to increase my sense of urgency & get hands-on sooner. In both the examples I gave earlier, I was comfortable waiting 2-3 months to see progress when I probably should have stepped in within ~weeks. If I self-reflect on this, I think there are several reasons why I didn’t:



1. “Not my job”: I had a mindset that other people owned this work and should be doing it. My job was to support them: coaching, maybe some training. I didn’t want to take away their autonomy. But then the impact slipped by several months, and I could have prevented that. My job is to maximize impact first and foremost.
2. “I’ve already done that”: I really wasn’t very interested in either working on Operations culture change or building dashboards, since I’ve done that before. I was hoping to teach others to do it but not have to do it myself, again. But at a startup we all need to roll up our sleeves sometimes and get the chores done, even if they aren’t interesting. That’s tough for me with my personality. 

I think I can avoid violating people’s autonomy while increasing impact by communicating clearer. My goals for the next 12 months:



1. O: Have a clear engineering priority list that drives urgency. 
    1. KR: Restart using my Monthly/Weekly prioritization process.
    2. KR: Have clear “finished” dates and “Dobromir gets involved” dates.
2. O: Communicate more clearly to teams to drive urgency.
    3. KR: Use my prioritization list to communicate WHAT I expect, and WHEN.	
        1. Maybe send a weekly email to all of engineering?
    4. KR: Communicate clearly WHAT I’ll do if I don’t see X progress by Y date.
        2. Probably do this in 1:1s with people I’ve delegated to.
3. O: Get hands-on faster, and always in at least 1 area.
    5. KR: For every area on my priority list where I’m delegating, **ask explicitly** if instead of delegating I should be hands-on immediately. 
    6. KR: Spend 16 hours/week hands-on on some project.
