# Summary

[EMPLOYEE] is **meeting expectations** as a Sr. Operations Manager. He has some excellent raw material that we can build
on to have him exceed expectations in a quarter or two. There are only two things he truly needs to focus on right now:
**availability** (very tactical) and **managing via process**. If he fixes the first one he’d be exceeding expectations
already and if he grows his skills in the second he’ll be on a fast-track to Director-level roles. I can’t stress enough
the need to fix availability; based on peer feedback it’s currently an issue but manageable, but if it doesn’t improve
over six months I expect it prevent [EMPLOYEE] from succeeding in his current role, as the team would lose confidence in
his control over the day-to-day.

[EMPLOYEE] needs to show progress on being more present in the office within the next month. Several people also
recommended that he take a more “physical presence” approach to the Annotation team - “be in the pit” - which makes
sense for an Operations manager. A classic Ops role has a lot of balls up in the air and the only way to effectively
know what’s going on is to be physically present to observe the juggling; even small things like sitting on the couch
send the wrong message about how involved/knowledgeable [EMPLOYEE] is about current state of the board.

If he fixes this, his sense of ownership, the empathy he shows to his team and peers, and his strengths as a people
manager will carry him far. He’s a sharp individual with deep experience and [COMPANY] is lucky to have him in this
role. Details and peer feedback on these strengths is overwhelming below.

To continue to grow as the company scales [EMPLOYEE] needs to add one important tool to his chest: Managing via Process.
The current feeling from the team and myself is that [EMPLOYEE] is leaning on 1:1 and relationships too much and hasn’t
put enough of his own process in place to catch issues before they arise and make sure work is being distributed
appropriately on the team. An example is how long it’s taken to get a basic tracking system up; I had to push for
several months and it’s still not smooth. It often feels like [EMPLOYEE] is riding the Operations bus rather than
driving it; it’s nice to have him in the back chatting it up with everyone and coming up front to let us know what is
happening - but it would be nicer just to hand him the steering wheel :)

As part of this growth I’m asking [EMPLOYEE] to put together personal OKRs for each quarter. He’ll need to write them
down, get them approved by me, and then check-in monthly on how he is doing. His performance score for the quarter will
reflect both his ability to do run this process for himself, as well as actually hit the goals he sets. This should be
good practice for becoming more process-oriented across the board.

# Strengths

## Ownership

[EMPLOYEE] has been excellent about owning the work that lands on his plate and taking it seriously. When he says
something will be done we can trust it will be handled. When he messes up he’s open about it, asks for feedback/advice,
and generally looks like he’s trying to correct.

There is an open question whether he will be able to get his own ownership to flow to the rest of the team more broadly;
as a manager his responsibility is not only to show ownership but to instill it in his organization.

Peer Feedback

* [EMPLOYEE] is doing very well considering he’s been thrown into the literal deep end.
* [PM] + [CTO]’s time on Ops has fallen close to zero. By that metric - everything is beautiful, fantastic.
* He takes ownership. You never need to extract an apology. He knows when he fucks up, takes it and fixes it. 4 for
  sure, I want to see more outside of just verbal ownership. Does it go back to the team.
* He is a guy who listens to feedback, if we start telling him about these things he’ll listen. He is not defensive. He
  takes ownership over it.
* [DIRECT-REPORT-2] sees it, I feel the Ops team - [[DIRECT-REPORT] and [DIRECT-REPORT-2] respect him.
* He has picked up everything about Operations, understood all the moving parts quickly. I have confidence in his
  ability to understand what will be an issue before it becomes an issue.
* He joined around the time that VAN was falling apart. Perfect place to see how he is, thrown into the fire. He handled
  it well; confidence rubbed off on others. Might be placebo effect but it’s helpful!
* If you give him something to do he’ll get it done, and on time too. VAN annotation was a shit show; I see a marked
  difference from when [[DIRECT-REPORT] was doing it, I was doing it, and how [EMPLOYEE] is organizing it. Pushing
  information instead of having people pull it out of him. He’s moving us out of the firefighting situation.
* I was thrown in the same position, he’s doing great. Bringing in someone like [DIRECT-REPORT] - that was perfect. It
  took the ambiguity out of our HW management which was a nightmare. That was a piece of Ops I didn’t even want to
  touch! I think we are in a good spot HW wise.
* [EMPLOYEE] always gets back to me on stuff. If I Slack, email, or call him I don’t have to worry about it going to a
  blackhole. He’s accountable. Sometimes it takes a while however. He’s pretty good at setting expectations on timeline
  and meeting it, or adjusting it in real-time - but he’s communicative. Not always the timelines I would like ;)
  Doesn’t require me to check-in, he’s proactive.

## Managing via Relationships

Peer Feedback

* Love that he promoted [DIRECT-REPORT-2]! He’s done a good job of empowering [DIRECT-REPORT-2] and helping people
  respect him and build additional management underneath him. He was a relatively new manager and it was a good move. He
  didn’t just shoot off the cuff, he made sure people were backing him and putting them in a chance to make a
  difference.
* He really wanted to understand my perspective, he really soaked it in, wanted to listen.
* Were there changes? Yes - it was unclear who I reported to, too many managers - wasn’t sure if I should go
  to [DIRECT-REPORT], [EMPLOYEE]… He listened to that and put a structure in place for us.
* [EMPLOYEE] took what we had to say into consideration. I advised him that communication was hectic and that I didn’t
  like that. The issues I had was how [[DIRECT-REPORT]] handled it. [EMPLOYEE] handled the situation well. “We are all
  part of the team, if somebody is not comfortable hearing somebody out…”
* Big things with [EMPLOYEE]; very upfront, tries to keep me in the loop. Working remotely is a big deal. He’s done a
  very good job with that.
* He’s super-easy to talk to, very willing to listen to, help in any way possible. Very helpful, especially since you
  don’t see each other face-to-face.
* He is systematic about things. E.g. Shell - when we had the meeting about Shell, how we would operate,
  and [DIRECT-REPORT-2] wasn’t comfortable - [EMPLOYEE] could not understand at first. But he is giving the opinion of
  others - bubbling the concerns of [DIRECT-REPORT-2] etc. Which is really necessary. The Ops team here feels like their
  voice is not heard. I blame [DIRECT-REPORT] for that; I think this is changing, heard that from multiple people. I
  give the credit to [EMPLOYEE] for making that happen.
* He makes himself available all the time. Very easy to talk to. He’s very honest, supportive. He seems sincere, he’ll
  be understanding with whatever you need to do. He respects you.
* The things that I like: he identifies key people and throws them into the right task. [DIRECT-REPORT], doubling down
  on [DIRECT-REPORT-2]. Seems to be a good manager: questions he asked during the interview process highlights how he
  values the management part.
* He’s putting people in places to help him out. He believes in his people; when [DIRECT-REPORT-2] feels strongly about
  something [EMPLOYEE] will back him/
* Better managers were more “in” what I’m doing. More involved manually with what I was doing. Here, he trusts us to get
  it done, come to him if we need anything - communication with the manager. He has the trust. He is not micromanaging
  which I really appreciate.

## Empathy

This is [EMPLOYEE]’s super-strength that makes the rest of this performance possible. He understands people and they
_feel understood_ which builds loyalty, respect, and trust. He values direct conversation and quiet listening and does
both well with body language, tone, and words that reinforce his caring.

This empathy is a foundational piece of his management style which will take him far.

Peer Feedback:

* He has fucking tremendous empathy! The way he deals with hard situations incredibly well. When [DIRECT-REPORT] was
  feeling antsy about possibly being terminated his chat with [DIRECT-REPORT] was instrumental in making [DIRECT-REPORT]
  feel secure. The words he’s using, the tone in his voice is very helpful. This is a powerful strength.
* Sometimes the lack of control [[MANAGER]: see below for context] might be overly empathetic? 4-5. I’ve seen streaks of
  him being an asshole. I don’t think he understood the craziness on Shell and why the decisions are changing so
  rapidly, he was pissed at us.
* He brings in the right balance between being empathetic to the people working hard in Ops and to the technology side,
  which we were missing.
* He’s very empathetic, valuable as a manager. I’ve seen him relate - I’ll use the [[DIRECT-REPORT] example, he handled
  it incredibly well.
* I liked his approach to the [DIRECT-REPORT] situation. The conversation he had when terminating him: very honest,
  open. Great job communicating with me ahead of time on best practices, making sure he had the right talk-track. Making
  sure he had everything in place before the conversation.

# Areas for Improvement

## Availability

[EMPLOYEE] has had a lot of personal issues over the last few months (family + health) and these are weighing on his
impact and team effectiveness now. As mentioned in the summary they are the main reason he is not exceeding expectations
right now. His team and peers have universally called this out as an issue and framed it with “we understand he’s going
through a lot”. While we understand personal issues may be out of his control, [EMPLOYEE] should understand that this
will quickly weigh on his reputation at the company and therefore ability to be effective.

[EMPLOYEE] should work hard in the next month to get a steady cadence in the office (I recommend before 9 to after 5 to
set the right tone), as well as change some behaviors in the office to be more hands-on with Annotation team. He should
take to hear the “be in the pit” feedback and figure out how to feel like part of the team in crunch-time.

Peer Feedback:

* A lot of this can be changed by availability, observing his team, following up more proactively. He can get help from
  others - we can help him out.
* I mean this lightly - overshadowed by the good - his physical presence is noted when it’s not there, especially since
  he is a manager. Sometimes it feels like we don’t have a manager. While he is performing an important function it has
  been detracted by his absence. “Where is [EMPLOYEE] in all of this?” He is not accessible - there are always things
  coming up. The net effect on us is there is no real figure behind you, standing over your shoulder. Necessary for a
  manager. This is personal life - I don’t think he’s shirking responsibilities - but it does have that net effect.
* Has never gotten to the point where we missed anything - he’s very active on Slack so he covers it. But he is missing
  the feeling of “I am in the manager, in the office, picking up the Slack - so should you.” Being physically in the
  loop sets a particular cultural tone.
* He’d be more than a 7 if he was here more. That would make him an 8. To be a 9: he would have to make me feel honored
  to work with him - it’s great to work with him - but I’m not honored to work with him yet. To really benefit to have
  worked with him. To make it a point to route my career to work with you. To have a 9: have a presence. “[MANAGER] is
  there, expecting something” - he needs that. Exemplify it - **having him in the corner, next to [[DIRECT-REPORT], that
  sets the tone. I would expect him - this would be more prudent - to be in the pit with us.**
* Sometimes I feel like he is not on top of things. There is a lot of stuff happening at home so I can’t blame him for
  that.
* Timeliness, hard to collaborate when he is rolling in at 10am or later. I’m afraid of setting meetings before 10am,
  I’m not sure what will happen. He has missed one in-person interview; he apologized profusely about the personal
  reason but it still was a real problem. You just don’t know if you put it on his calendar if he’s going to show up.
* I know he’s been sick, he hasn’t been here a lot lately. But I know he’s there for us.
* He doesn’t have as much interaction with his team as I expected a people manager to have. He’s not in the office that
  much - he has personal situations, he explained to me - but even when he is here he is on the couch rather than
  sitting with his team.
* Consequences? I want to be able to turn and just talk to him - and when he’s not here he’s difficult to reach
  remotely. It would be different if it was like [PEER], where if you Slack him or Zoom him he’s right there.
  With [EMPLOYEE] it’s difficult if he’s not physically present. When he is here - super easy to collaborate. Remote -
  very difficult.

## Managing via Process

The best summary of this feedback is “**I’m pretty confident that Ops, as it is today, cannot scale.” **[EMPLOYEE] has
been incredibly slow to put together a weekly process and regular metrics to verify that his team is working as
expected (both in-house annotation as well as field ops). This means we could hire another [PEER] in the field and fail
to train them or see that they are messing up in the field - because the data won’t be there to catch it and the process
to check that data won’t exist. This leads to things like different workloads on different team members ([DIRECT-REPORT]
constantly doing other work, [DIRECT-REPORT] saying she doesn’t feel very utilized).

Examples range from our weekly check-ins (usually no agenda from [EMPLOYEE], definitely no concrete metrics or goals
review), to the Operations board (I had to push for it for months, and finally propose my own version), to a lack of
data on where Operations spends their time (I had to pull my own estimates on registration etc so we could understand
the overall model).

[EMPLOYEE] will not be able to run a 30-40 person team if he doesn’t take metrics and process very, very seriously. He
should be proposing and implementing his own ways of doing this and driving the meetings with me based on his agenda and
team needs. He should know better the state of everything on his team than I do (or [CTO] does). Improving
signal-to-noise ratios is its own set of skills and I haven’t seen [EMPLOYEE] shine here.

Peer feedback:

* I’ve noticed - as the first DC - issues from the beginning. Things we could do to better the team. I really believe in
  team meetings, bi-weekly or monthly. The Ops team down here doesn’t really feel like we get feedback. **We still don’t
  get any feedback**. We’re not just the grunts down here - we’re smart - biweekly or monthly meetings would help.
* We had one standup meeting when [PM] got hired. That was it. We’ve complained about it but it hasn’t happened.
* E.g. [CEO] is prescriptive in how work should be done; will follow up again & again. [EMPLOYEE] is on the other end: *
  *the controls are a bit loose.** The control loop is not running fast enough.
* I still need to keep a lookout re: [DIRECT-REPORT]’s behavior. I have not seen a lot change - I see more text editors
  than registration on screen. I don’t think it’s 50/50 between them.
* Process: definitely on “not enough” side, probably on the “little bit”. I feel like a lot of the processes he has have
  been inherited by [MANAGER]’s actions. I want to see him come up with his own path.** I’m pretty confident that Ops,
  as it is today, cannot scale. **We are OK today - fighting fires - but won’t be tomorrow.
* Better balanced now - but it could still be more balanced. Feels like [DIRECT-REPORT-2] is taking on a lot of
  responsibility. Maybe task more to the rest of the team. I thought [DIRECT-REPORT] and [PEER] were doing annotation
  then I found out they are doing registration. Maybe [DIRECT-REPORT-2] could task out more. As a Team Lead he’s getting
  adjusted to the role,
* I think he needs to be more front & center. He needs to instill confidence in The Person Running Operations. Not that
  I think people don’t have confidence in him - but the main blocker is operations - and he’s taking on a massive
  endeavor to remove that stigma. Updates on planning, Tecture, etc - would love to see a lot more info. Reading
  people’s updates, it’s not clear what folks are working on.
* In the next 12 months: we can do 5x what we are doing today with the same number of people.
* Imbalance on the Ops team - some people don’t take the job very seriously. I think there is potential for all the
  folks; I want to see [EMPLOYEE] work on this.
* Help us pin down more things that are clogging us. Ways we could improve communication between all of us. The actual
  process - who has which file, are things ready.

## Information Flow/Training

As part of the process improvements above I believe [EMPLOYEE] has hampered himself by not fully training himself on
what his team does, and therefore not being able to understand what training his team needs and how communication should
flow through it. This will inhibit his ability to see around corners (e.g. get the Tecture team trained earlier) or be
the expert we need in this seat.

I highly recommend that [EMPLOYEE] goes deeper into every part of what his team does, maybe one day a week, and use that
knowledge to (a) develop better training, (b) make sure communication on the team works right (correct org structure), (
c) put in the processes to extract signal-from-noise.

Peer Feedback:

* **I don’t feel like I have the proper training to give any news/information from [COMPANY]. Answering questions - I
  just feel silly sometimes. I feel like I’m just a body in the chair, it would help a lot if I was trained a bit
  more. **Even a couple days of training up in HQ would help a ton.
* Would be helpful to have more context on how the rover works and why HQ is fixing it the way they are.
* Get our perspective on how things can be done down here.
* E.g. [PEER] and the India team can be getting better, learning on new data - he’s not pushing them hard enough.
* I would expect more. [PEER] and [EMPLOYEE] have a good relationship going on; but I’m not sure where [[DIRECT-REPORT]
  fits into that piece, not sure if [[DIRECT-REPORT] knows. Does he know what he is responsible for? What he is supposed
  to improve on?
* Don’t know if this falls under job title or not - but constant communication with [PEER], [EMPLOYEE] has been working on
  Ops for a while, and I don’t think [PEER] has ever talked to him. I don’t know if that’s the plan or not. I would
  reference [EMPLOYEE] to [PEER] and [PEER] said “I don’t even know who that is.” I don’t know if that is how it’s supposed
  to go. [PEER] felt disconnected because I was getting information from someone he didn’t have any contact with.
* Daily communication - even if it’s a quick 2-3 minute phone call with [EMPLOYEE]. I send him a daily report every day.
  Early on he was doing onboarding, he was sick - daily communication was tough. I want to be in as much of the loop as
  I can be. Often [PEER] comes to me with questions and I would direct him to [PM] or [[DIRECT-REPORT] - but the more I
  know the quicker I can give communication to the client.
* I think I could be utilized a bit more. I have a diverse skill set - communication, customer service is my background.
  Anything I can do to help with anything there - I’d be willing and happy to do anytime. If you want to put more
  responsibility on me I’d be happy to do. Be aware of skills and interests.
* Only in scheduled 1:1s. Very little discussion that happens outside structured meetings. I would prefer it to be
  constant - then you get to the hard nuggets in 1:1s.
* I didn’t get as much onboarding from [EMPLOYEE] as I was expecting. He did a 1:1 with me to touch base. It was
  straight to training and annotating. It would have been good to get more understanding of the workflow and processes.
  I asked him about documentation to refer to, he said it was in progress, might be done by EOY. I haven’t heard back
  about it.
* My past managers were able to help with projects, assignments - they knew the tools as well - but I think he’s
  managing the overall, that’s not part of his responsibility? But it would be helpful.
* [[DIRECT-REPORT] had more knowledge. That field experience was incredibly valuable. [EMPLOYEE] isn’t dropping balls
  but it is causing decisions to be made slower than it needs to be. Have to ask for more info or verify info. Poses
  interesting problems; e.g. KD is not 1 floor/person, but we didn’t raise it earlier, and now we are struggling;
  could [EMPLOYEE] have jumped on that faster?
* I’d love to see a better flow between Eng and Ops. Help Ops formulate customer asks to engineering, in a product
  sense. I hear complaints from Annotators about certain things - “how is this named??” - simple fix for Eng. [EMPLOYEE]
  should be helping there. I’d like to see more product-ized internal tools. [EMPLOYEE] should be able to get us there;
  he has a good background for it.
* He could have been more present on the team for onboarding; he wasn’t in the office when [DIRECT-REPORT] and Austin
  were starting. He didn’t have a plan for them. They were left to fend for themselves.
