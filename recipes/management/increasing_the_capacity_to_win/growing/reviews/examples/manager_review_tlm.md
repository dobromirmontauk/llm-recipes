# Overview

[EMPLOYEE] is **strongly exceeding my expectations** as a Sr. Software Engineer at [COMPANY]. His leadership of the Data Capture team, which he inherited from [PEER] in 2020, has led to an incredibly reliable and stable delivery engine for our weekly mobile LIDAR scans - something we weren’t sure was really achievable at the beginning of the year! He’s effectively combined strong leadership skills with an unusually wide technical background across computer vision, hardware, machine learning, and infrastructure. 

[EMPLOYEE] really needs to work on a few things to reach the next level:



1. Avoiding overcommitting. Balancing team leadership and individual technical contributions is difficult; while he mostly made the right calls on-the-spot he wasn’t able to predict how much IC work he would do correctly. 
2. Own a bigger, end-to-end technical contribution with higher complexity. While [EMPLOYEE] has delivered super impactful work across the data pipeline, scanner evaluation, and Verificator, he hasn’t sunk his teeth into a very meaty complex project and delivered it with the help of several other senior people.
3. Slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio. I still need to “pull” information from [EMPLOYEE], for example weekly metrics, reports on device performance, or updates on team execution. He would be more effective (and save others time) if he pushed the relevant updates/decisions/risks proactively and essentially eliminated the need to ever poll him. 

His peers have noticed and are wondering how we’ll give [EMPLOYEE] the right balance:



* He is stuck in the TL role. (...) Maybe we need to find a suitable role at [COMPANY] so he can be more impactful. E.g. John is super-productive because he has the opportunity + space to show his skills. 
* He does need more core technical contributions - he craves it.

I tend to agree that [EMPLOYEE] ought to focus on hard technical problems (ideally combined with end-to-end product development, since he enjoys that) for a few more years - for his own satistication! That said, he is one of the stronger leaders at the company and can provide more value in the next 6 months by accelerating the engineers around him and not just individual contributions. We’ve discussed having him take over the ML/CV team and we should make a decision on this soon. If he wants assurances that he’ll have an IC role again at some point we should set expectations with the team and work towards that goal together. 

That said, I’d also like to get [EMPLOYEE]’s thoughts on where he will be in 5 years. As he calls out himself he likes “lazy evaluation” so he seems to be avoiding thinking about this deeply at the moment. It may be wise for him to reflect on it, make a decision, and commit - knowing that it can always be changed later. His peers definitely think he has untapped potential:



* I’d love to see [EMPLOYEE] refine that customer exposure and pedigree. He feels like he could grow into a significant, senior engineer who has a big impact on the whole self-serve/GC thing. The value of having him in front of GCs and having that interaction, hear how GCs are talking, I think there would be a lot of value to sit in those meetings and ask intelligent eng questions. He has potential if he is interested in doing this. Sr. Directors of engineering - have to interact with non-engineering types.


# Strengths


## Team Leadership

[EMPLOYEE]’s leadership style can be described as “grace under fire.” He’s very much in the hot seat since his team is on the front lines of device deployment, testing, debugging, and getting data into our Annotator’s hands. Things go wrong all the time - the pager load is heavy, averaging ~15-20 hours/week - yet [EMPLOYEE] takes it calmly and slowly but surely improved the system and the team. It’s hard to faze him, technically or socially, and this has built respect with his team and peers. He uses just the right amount of process to keep it productive despite a mix of senior and junior people, strong opinions and quiet individuals. 

In our 1:1s [EMPLOYEE] is thoughtful about his team and always looking to get coaching on how get the most out of them and improve himself as a leader. I’ve enjoyed these conversations since I see him go and try out new techniques and usually succeed. 

Feedback



* Team lead: he’s doing great. He was put into a position he wasn’t expecting, he’s really grown into the role. Still has a lot to learn :) Keeping people on-task. Very involved in what people are doing in a given day. He does take his managerial role seriously.
* Very helpful with on-call, going through examples.
* Very responsive. Every time I had a question he’s been there. Weekly 1:1s - work related. Talk about my outlook for the future. [EMPLOYEE] has really made expectations clear.
* Based on where the team is I don’t think he needed to do more - the team needed him to be doing what he is doing. More of the management side, people stuff, meeting stuff - at the cost of the technical contributions. What he said about getting people to the point of delegating - yes, that is the right approach.
* He’s a great TL - always keeping us on-track. Keeping the discussion relevant in meetings. Tying things back into OKRs. Pushing us to the right technical choices long-term. Recognizes deficiencies of the current system and thinking about how to break it apart and roll it out. Balances where we are today, where we are going.
* D.C. team made significant progress this year. Team Lead should be evaluated by team performance. We integrated 2 devices into production pipeline, created new tools to deal with these devices, and despite growing number of sites was able to deliver on-time to next stage of production. All of it with short manpower. 
* He maintained the internal culture so everyone is proactive. Minimum number of meetings. 
* Where DC has changed is night & day. Not just because we changed devices, the pipeline changes are fundamental and he should take credit for it. We started a MSFT pilot and got a scan in the pipeline in 72 hours??? We never thought that would be possible a year ago!
* Puts the line in the sand. I learn from that a lot. He tells you when something is on the other side of the line, he hasn’t committed to it. I’ve learned you have to make them clear - if someone wants to cross it you have to be vocal about it. That has been helpful to me.
* Very fast to respond to issues. I know the DC team didn’t use to be fast; [EMPLOYEE] turned that around. If I have an issue and it isn’t solved - [EMPLOYEE] will solve it for me. 
* During the BLK situation, I had an opportunity to collaborate with [EMPLOYEE]  in reference to troubleshooting and testing. At that time, I was new to [COMPANY] and was stepping into a less than ideal situation; [EMPLOYEE] helped me feel valued and supported. His willingness to jump on a conference call at any time day or night to bounce ideas back and forth, with his daughter dancing in the background, spoke volumes about his dedication to seeing the issue through to its resolution.

Improve:



* Scans that don’t make it through the pipeline - DCTs have to report it to the Annotators - that’s a bit broken. Should take a little more end-to-end ownership here. I think he understands this, it’s my only grief. 


## Intellectual Honesty

[EMPLOYEE] is incredibly sharp yet manages to wield his intellect in a respectful way with a clear desire to get to the truth. He has a strong internal compass that is very well aligned with [COMPANY]’s other values of humbleness, empathy, decisiveness, and ownership. The recent incident with Bueno (outside the scope of this document) shows how much [EMPLOYEE] is capable to keep [COMPANY]ians intellectually honest in a comfortable atmosphere. He’s truly a bar raiser in that regard.

Feedback:



* “The one person I fear questions from!” Intellectual accountability that he holds his peers to is terrifying and refreshing. I know he will ask tough questions. I like that about him, we need more people like that. More people digging into the nitty gritty.
* I think he is more of a 5. He is not worried to make me a little uncomfortable, we’ve found a lot of circumstances where I rocked the boat and criticized and he’s never taken that amiss. I’m happy about that. 
* he is a non-nonsense person, calls it like he sees it. He took up the mantle of smoothing things over with Bueno.


## Doing it Right

[EMPLOYEE] cares deeply about doing things the right way and constantly brings this up with his peers and me. He’s had good instincts in cases like making DAGs pure functions and executed well; in many others he still needs to translate his thoughts into actual action. 

Feedback



* Talking about abstract ideas, enhancements to our systems, etc. Discussions I have with [EMPLOYEE] I wish I had with everyone! I really enjoy them. Even if we can’t solve all the problems at least we come up with good proposals.
* He’s very opinionated, strict on what gets merged into a codebase. Someone had a PR with unrelated changes. Responsibility of the PR was opaque; correct thing would be to separate it into PRs. [EMPLOYEE] held his ground. 
* [EMPLOYEE] personally integrated M6 and registration DAG. 
* Made efforts to improve quality of our software, e.g. testing, more metrics for the code. 


# Areas for Improvement


## Overcommitting

Over the last few quarters I saw [EMPLOYEE] slip on some of his IC contributions. He’s correctly prioritizing the team effectiveness over his own personal contributions but he could do even better and set realistic expectations on what he’ll be able to contribute. 

Feedback



* [EMPLOYEE] took on too many of the OKRs. Trying to do the Verificator work - that was delegatable (consensus-based). 
* I noticed on self-review that he doesn’t have many single unit coding projects. That has a lot to do because of hiring, meetings, lack of significant coding projects.
* I think he is trying to balance personal contribution vs. team running smoothly. Sometimes he struggles with it. A lot of decisions are blocked on him


## Just The Right Amount of Process

[EMPLOYEE] is a solid “B” when it comes to process (not too much, not too little). To get to an “A” he needs be more proactive in pushing information to relevant parties (especially managing up) in the right format. Getting metrics, regular progress, etc has required a lot of reminding. He sees this as a chore and perhaps undervalues the acceleration that good stakeholder management provides. E.g. one member of his team was worried that “management wouldn’t let us finish improving our oncall” ; this smells like they are not seeing [EMPLOYEE] actively influencing me + execs. Regular communication about in-flight projects, key metrics, etc can help a lot in these cases.

Feedback



* Goal setting, company mission, team mission: I wasn’t around to see that. I’ve seen problems where there was no direction from the top and I think [EMPLOYEE] has done a great job of figuring out the priorities and aligning them. There were goals in-place when I arrived. The team has arrived at more refined goal, OKRs. The questions are less “what are the goals” and more “how do we accomplish them?”
* He doesn’t find the process pieces interesting. But sometimes it is useful for the team. 
* Not well-defined: not enough structure how tasks are carried out. Want to see particular coding practice, agile, leaning more on that.
* I’ve had to push for keeping daily standups - only platform to share about what everyone is working on.
* I was not ready for onboarding in oncall - he realized today we could have prepped me a bit more. He recognized that well and made a note to fix it.
