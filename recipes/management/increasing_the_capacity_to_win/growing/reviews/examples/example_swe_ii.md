Rubric:

(1: Strongly Does Not Meet, 2: Does Not Meet, 3: Meets, 4: Exceeds, 4.5-5: Strongly Exceeds)

Overall performance score: 3.64, Meets Expectations \

* [Expectation of Role](REDACTED): 3.33
    * Coding: 3
        * REDACTED is working within expectations of a SWEII. I would like to see REDACTED thinking of using unit tests,
          documentation, and code organization in the next quarter to build out code that can be understood and built on
          top of by others.
            * Suggestions:
                * Use TDD in the code writing process. Write tests first (good tests are usually formed from acceptance
                  criteria), and then develop.
    * Architecture: 3
        * REDACTED gets shit done. He worked side by side with [PEER] to do what was needed to get SiteWalk out. The
          next step for REDACTED is to think about [COMPANY] architecture and what steps we need to take to build
          products off of generalized services we define. In other words, REDACTED needs to think beyond the current
          needs and find time to implement for medium and long term needs.
            * Suggestions to increase rigor:
                * REDACTED has good ideas on how to decrease toil. A good start here is to find out how to work the work
                  he has planned into the sprints and contextualize how it will accelerate efforts 1 sprint, 2 sprint, 3
                  sprint down the line.
    * Domain: 4
        * REDACTED built off his knowledge of data capture and computer vision to augment the data capture pipelines to
          deliver what was needed for SiteWalk.
* Contribution to Team / Impact: 4
    * REDACTED was an essential member of the backend team that worked with the frontend team to bring SiteWalk to life.
      His deep understanding of the data capture domain allowed us to onboard our customers relatively easily and
      implemented data pipelines to process the VSLAM and VLX data feeds to generate the appropriate pano and
      orientation data.
    * To get to a 5, REDACTED will need to share knowledge of the domain with others more effectively. This was hard for
      REDACTED to do this quarter due to time constraints and immediate action required to get the release out.
* [[COMPANY] Virtues](REDACTED): 3.6
    * Ownership: 4
        * REDACTED is very customer focused. Coming from an ops background, he brings with him an understanding that
          customer commitments are important and gets things done to get there.
    * Decisiveness: 3
        * REDACTED gets things done. To get to the next level, REDACTED needs to self manage and find out how he can
          automate himself out of that ops mindset. Relieving himself of “operations” work that followed him will be the
          path in which will unlock his ability to deliver further impact at [COMPANY].
            * Suggestion: continue working within the confines of delivering software with product managers to find a
              communication pattern which will allow you to tackle down technical debt as a commitment.
    * Humble: 4
        * REDACTED understands that making [COMPANY] successful is a team effort. He’s aware of how all the different
          organizations work together to deliver value to the customer.
    * Empathy: 3
        * One of the areas where time will allow REDACTED to improve on. As REDACTED develops professionally, he needs
          to understand that technical prowess is only one component of success. The other component is being able to
          use EQ to excel at working in a team environment working towards a common goal.
            * Suggestion: Interviews are a good self-contained format for recognizing the needs of others and how it is
              complementary to technical ability when determining whether a candidate should go forward or not.
    * Intellectual Honesty: 4
        * REDACTED strives to achieve outcomes with precision when it comes to the approach for automating operations
          work or extracting data out of the sensors we use. I want to see more of this when it comes to software
          architecture since it is just as important.
