# Philosophy
Our Performance Review approach is intended to reinforce some core pieces of our [company virtues]():

* **Ownership**: we expect our employees to be _owners_, which includes ownership over their growth, career, and personal performance. Our employees should be striving to improve themselves with the support of their colleagues and manager.
* **Decisiveness:**  we expect our employees to act quickly, with conviction. Our employees can make the judgement call of “good” versus “great” for quality of work when it comes to “fast” versus “slow” pace of completion.
* **Intellectual Honesty**: we expect our empoyees to challenge peers so we can win as a company, faster. For Performance Reviews this means providing direct, actionable feedback backed by examples. 
* **Empathy**: we expect our employees to _care about each other_, which means understanding that feedback _can be a gift_ if provided in a feedback in a respectful, considerate manner.
* **Humility**: we expect our employees to be proud of their work, but acknowledging of all of the people who made such work possible.  No one is an island, and recognition of that fact is important in demonstrating strength of character.  In other words, don’t be a jerk :) 


# Participation

Performance Reviews will be mandatory for all employees who’ve been here for >6 months.

They may also be done for other employees, at the discretion of their manager. 

**Performance Reviews will be used for all compensation adjustments, refresher grants, promotion considerations, etc. **Employees who do not complete their Performance Reviews _on time_ will not be eligible for such considerations.** **


# Process

In order to implement our Performance Review philosophy we are implementing the following process:

1. **Self Review**: each employee will write a _self-review_ that is shared with their peers (chosen by the Manager/Employee).
2. **Manager Review**: each employee will have a verbal Manager review provided based on the self-review and Manager feedback. Whenever possible, the Manager will include peer feedback from interviews or written feedback. Optionally, the Manager can provide a written Manager review (this is generally encouraged, especially for remote employees, but it is not required).
3. **Peer Review (optional)**: each employee will be reviewed by their peers across the company.
4. **Performance Score**: each employee will be given a score, 1-5, across the following dimensions. 1 = “Does not meet expectations”, 2 = “Sometimes meets expectations”, 3 = “Meets expectations”, 4 = “Sometimes exceeds expectations”, 5 = “Strongly exceeds expectations”. 
    1. **Expectation of Role**: how is the employee doing in their role at their current level? 
        1. Role expectations for Engineering are [here]()
        2. Role expectations for Operations are here
        3. Role expectations for Sales are here
    2. **Contribution to Team: **how is the employee helping their teammates and Company improve?
    3. **Demonstration of Company Virtues: **how well does the employee demonstrate [our Virtues]()?
    4. **Overall Impact**: how is the employee helping us win?


## Self Review

The Self Review is the anchor of the company’s Performance Review systems. It serves two main purposes:

1. Ensures that the employee is thinking about their own performance, both strengths and areas for improvement, so that they can consciously think about the next few years of their career.
2. Provides peers with a “refresher” that will help them target their feedback to maximize the usefulness to the employee. Everyone is busy and may not remember the details of what others have worked on; the Self Review provides that context.

The Self Review takes work. It should be about 2 pages long (no more than 3, no less than 1!) and take ~hours to write (4 hours is a good median; 2 hours means you’re not thinking enough). It should cover **the last 12 months at the company, with more focus on the last 6 months.** 

**Self Reviews should strictly follow this format -[ use this template]()**:


1. **Responsibilities & Projects section** (repeat 3-5 times):
    1. Project Name or Responsibility & 1-paragraph description
    2. Your contributions to this responsibility/project. 1-2 paragraphs.** Include documentation **(docs you wrote, pull requests, code reviews, links to metrics) - _no documentation is a big no-no_.
    3. **Impact** of your contribution to the project (small, medium, large, critical).
    4. 1-2 ideas of what you could have done better. 1 paragraph.
2. **Strengths section** (repeat 2-3 times):
    5. Describe a strength and give a few examples. You can use the [company Expectations]() for examples of what could be strengths (across your role or Company Virtues).
3. **Areas for Improvement section **(repeat 2-3 times):
    6. Describe an area for improvement and give a few examples. You can use the [company Expectations]() for examples of what could be something you want to work on (across your role or Company Virtues).
4. **Demonstration of Company Virtues**
    7. Ownership, Intellectual Honesty, Decisiveness, and Empathy...Score yourself according to the rubric outlined [here]() and please provide 1-2 of your strongest examples in each category.  
        1. For those that you fall short in, please explain why you believe this/these values to be important/unimportant and what actions you plan to take to improve in the future.

## Peer Review (optional!)

Every Employee will nominate 3-7 peers to review them. Peer reviews will be written with either the manager “interviewing” the peer or through some other process. Peers will have the Self Review available ahead of time and are expected to put quite a bit of thought into each Peer Review - **these are important and affect the career and growth of your team mates!**

A good Peer Review has lots of examples and touches on every part of a Self Review, and ideally parts that the Employee might have left out. They will follow this template:



1. Project Section (repeated for every project in Self Review):
    1. What was impressive about the employee’s contributions to this project?
    2. How could the employee have contributed even more to this project?
2. Strengths Section (repeated for every strength in Self Review):
    3. Do you agree with this strength? Give examples of yes/no.
3. AFI Section (repeated for every AFI in Self Review):
    4. Do you agree with this AFI? Give examples of yes/no.
4. One more thing…
    5. If you could magically change one thing about your peer, what would it be?


## Manager Review

The Manager will collect all of the Peer Feedback (if collected), anonymize it, and write their own Peer Review that includes their opinions as well as the Peer Feedback opinions with supporting quotes. This review will be presented in writing with the employee and then reviewed in-person as a kick-off to discuss the Performance Score below and goals for the next year.


## Performance Score

The Performance Score is a measure of a Employee’s skills and impact across the dimensions that matter most to Company as a business. While this score is influenced by the Peer Feedback, _it is independent and may not reflect the feedback directly_. Ultimately, the manager of the individual is responsible for setting the Performance Score and working with the employee on improving their performance. 

The Overall Company Impact score is also set at the manager’s discretion. In some cases, this may be an average of the other performance scores; in other cases, it might be a min() or max(). The reason for that is the actual impact an individual has on the company is **very unique** to the role they are in, projects they are working on, personal attributes, etc and so there is no formula that can be applied across the board.

Expectations across the team at large is that most individuals will be at “Meets Expectations” (3) at the beginning of their roles and slowly move towards “Exceeds” and then “Strongly Exceeds”, with eventual promotion once a track-record of Strongly Exceeds has been demonstrated for enough time.


# What Comes Next

Performance Reviews don’t exist in isolation. They are a regular step in a cycle of growth. After this step, Employees should work with their managers on personal OKRs (tied to company OKRs) that will help them improve in ways that are important to them and helpful to the company.

This process will be facilitated by managers and driven by employees, since they are responsible for their own career and future performance at the company.

## FAQ



* Q: During peer reviews, should we try to determine what the person we’re reviewing is responsible for _before _the peer review interview?

    A: No!  Say what’s on your mind and we’ll talk through the actual responsibilities/expectations of that individual during your peer review.

* Q: For peer reviews, are you within your rights to mention strengths or weaknesses that they _didn’t _point out themselves?  

    A:  Yes, absolutely.  You’re encouraged to do exactly that!  It’s not your job just to affirm/deny just what they’ve written.  You’re not constrained by it.

* Q: How much time should I spend on this?

    A: Probably 2-4 hours (shouldn’t be longer than 4 or else that’s going to be too much).

* Q: If I’m newer, can I still ask for feedback?

    A: You should _always _be doing this.  If you’d like a more formal evaluation (if you’ve 	been here for less than 3 months) then you should check in with your manager. 

* Q: What is the process of actually getting the peer reviews?

    A: In your self-review, please outline who you think should be reviewing you.  Then your manager will determine if there is anyone additionally that should be included here.

* Q: Who do my self-evaluations get sent to?

    A: Your manager, your peers (who are doing your review), HR and whoever you want to send it to.

* Q: Peer feedback: who do we have as peers if we only have worked with maybe 1-2 people? \
A: Look cross-departmentally!
* Q: Can I sent unsolicited feedback? \
A: YES! Feel free to send feedback to managers (or peers, if you feel comfortable) at any time, even outside the the Feedback process.
