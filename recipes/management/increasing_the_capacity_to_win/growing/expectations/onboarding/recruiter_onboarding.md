# 30-Day Objective

This is an example of what we expect from you in the first 30 days. The objectives set out below are owned by you: if you feel they are not aggressive enough, or not even the right objectives, just let us know! I expect you to quickly develop an excellent judgment of _what is important_ and the ownership to _Get It Done._

[COMPANY] is growing quickly: we are looking to hire ~50 CRITICAL and HIGH priority individuals, ideally in 6-9 months. If we include our India annotation/labelers this goes up to ~70 people. If our growth remains healthy we may end up with another +20 hires. Our product is bottlenecked today on having enough PMs and Engineers to figure out what needs to be done and do it. Our Sales is bottlenecked on having enough sales people and marketing people to generate and close leads. Hiring world-class people at this pace (~5-6/month!) isn’t easy - that’s why you are here :)

As [COMPANY]’s in-house recruiter you will be responsible for improving our hiring processes across the company, managing the day-to-day candidate and interview flow, training our managers and individuals on good recruiting practices, managing 3rd-party recruiting relationships (if needed), and building out the recruiting team to meet our company objectives. 

You will begin by reporting to **[MANAGER] (**Head of Engineering) with a dotted-line reporting to **Brian **(Head of Sales), your two main customers. About 50% of your time should go into Engineering and Product org hiring, 30% into Sales hiring, and 20% into the rest of the company. Expect this to change regularly as we have many competing priorities; success for you requires setting expectations with your various internal customers and then beating them!

# Day 1: Onboarding

Spend the day getting acquainted with [COMPANY] and our recruiting flow.



1. Go through [[COMPANY] Onboarding Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PPX8XP4jNpYc14z2oWBaQPuyk36pk4qzvN8w7ZarhDY/edit#heading=h.ojoml789wx4). 
    1. Make sure you’re done with Logistics. 
    2. The Onboarding is targeted at Engineering and you should pick & choose which topics you want to participate in. We have another engineer joining the CI team on 2/15 (Abhijeet) so we’ll have sessions in Week 2 that you should shadow. Work with  to get scheduled for those.
2. Review [[COMPANY]’s 2021 Company Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GcaBsMltXg3cVN8XC99qi_xo2LgDn5M9zNLzuH25EPw/edit), Q1 Plan, and [Hiring Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Da4rEpCmpdmlG3xQlgXumXzlNrxc346yCmEQePRdMrI/edit#gid=0).
    3. Follow as many links as you can and read as much as you can. Don’t worry if you get a bit lost :)
3. 9am: Meet with [MANAGER] to go through this onboarding doc and talk about the first week.
4. 9:30am: Attend [MANAGER]’s Staff meeting to meet the rest of the Engineering leadership team. You will be supporting a lot of these people. 
5. 10:30am: Attend [COMPANY]’s Product Planning meeting. I’ve added these to your calendar so you can get visibility into the Product process, upcoming launches, etc. Over the next few months this should help you understand our company and how to communicate it to candidates.
6. 11:30am: Meet with Brian. Discuss how he is doing hiring now and how you can support him in the first month. This plan will be focused more on Product/Eng and you should come up with a separate plan with Brian.

    4. Go through our current hiring process (HM Screen, Technical screen, etc).
    5. Go through active candidates
    6. Go through active roles

    13. Deb, Will (Richard Turner), Alex Honda

# Day 2: Take Over Scheduling

Nobody owns our candidate scheduling flow right now; I’ve asked Arun/Sergey/Raj to do it themselves. You can help by immediately taking over where every candidate is in the flow and making sure we are moving them through quickly. 



1. 9am: All Hands: meet the whole company!
    1. We’ll give you a warm welcome! 
    2. Slides for all-hands are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1knK_rZMzdG1SFMbr4flMLQO2_2dOjIzRSOtV9xwi290/edit#slide=id.g5c72d1ec21_4_84). There’s a slide for you to introduce yourself. Please put some fun stuff on there. The company normally does 2 truths and a lie. 
2. Clean up Lever.
    3. Make sure every candidate is in the right state.
    4. Follow up with any HMs/candidates if unclear where they are.
    5. Schedule all follow up interviews for folks that have fallen through the cracks. Get interview panels etc from HM or me.
    6. Go through all the JDs and make sure they look/feel consistent. Start mapping them to the Hiring Plan from Day 1. Figure out what we are missing or which JDs need to be improved.

1. Actively manage our candidate pipeline across the company
    1. Keep candidates warm and moving through pipeline quickly.
