# Scorecards

# Dobromir's Scorecard Recipes
I have to admit, I love scorecards. They were one of the very first tools I use religiously and published on my [Github](https://github.com/dobromirmontauk/engineering-scorecards). I love them so much because they do 3 important things:

1. They force _me_ to really think about what success in a role really looks like.
2. Collaboratively creating them (e.g. during a hiring process) creates a shared understanding of what success in a role looks like.
3. Using them during growth/performance conversations prevents the default vagueness trap.

Here is my approach:
* No fewer than 4 'top-level' sections, no more than 6. 
    * It's unlikely that you have fewer than 4 dimensions of expectations for an employee. Don't skip an entire dimension and then notice you "don't feel like" they are doing well, but their scorecard looks perfect.
    * Avoid more than 6 because nobody will remember that many. The 5-6th ones should almost be optional/nice-to-have.
    * Order the top-level sections according to importance, STRICTLY. That means the #2 thing on the list is less important than #1. You don't have to specify how much less important -- but don't get into the trap that they need to be perfect across ALL the 4-6 dimensions.
* 3-5 bullet points per section.
    * This puts meat on the bones, don't skip it. For example, 'execution' might be your #1 item on the scorecard, but what does that mean? Define 'great execution' in detail. Give examples.
    * If you can't get at least 3 bullet points, consider cutting the top-level section. It might not be that important to you.


## Technical Leads
I've broken up my expectations for technical leads to 3 different types I've noticed in the wild. Which one makes the most sense depends on the exact role; more details within each scorecard.

See my recipe on Technical Leadership Culture [here](link_needed).

* [Gardener](gardener_tl_scorecard.md): TLs that have long-lasting responsibilities for a given problem area. 
* [Warrior](warrior_tl_scorecard.md): TLs that have short-to-medium responsibilities to ship solutions to problems.
* [Uber-TL)](uber_tl_scorecard.md): TLs that have a 'wide-area network' set of responsibilities, where they can no longer pay attention to all the details.

## Engineering Management
For engineering management roles I create both generic scorecards to help explain expectations at the different levels, and role-specific scorecards for a given company/role when I'm hiring. For the generic ones the sections are generally not ordered by importance. For a role-specific scorecard I *mostly* reorder the generic ones so the prioritization is correct, but sometimes there are specific criterias for success in that role which is missing from the generic one.

* Twitter Roles
    * [Ad Serving EM](twitter_ad_serving_em.md)
    * [Billing & Payments EM](twitter_billing_payments_em.md)
* Doxel Roles
    * [Frontend EM](doxel_fe_em.md)
* [Generic Director](director.md): broadly speaking, a manager-of-managers or manager-of-multiple-technical-areas.
* [Generic VP](vp_of_eng.md)  (stolen from Wade): the overall owner of engineering, reporting to the CEO (could also be Head of Engineering).

## Where I use this
* Used in my [Hiring Recipe](link_needed)
* Used in my [Growth Recipe](link_needed)
* Used in my [Performance Review Recipe](link_needed)
    * Score 1-5 on each one.
    * One example demonstrating this score in the last 3 months.
    * One example of what is needed to hit the next score.
* Used in my [Eng Culture Recipe](link_needed)
