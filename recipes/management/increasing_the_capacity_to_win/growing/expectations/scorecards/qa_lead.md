# QA Lead Scorecard

The QA Lead is responsible for ensuring that the Product Engineering team can efficiently release quality features to customers. This focus on quality is applied at multiple steps in the development process, but should always be implemented in a way that helps empower Engineers to deliver quality features faster.

A QA Lead is a critical hire for a startup. There are many ways for QA Leads to create the wrong "quality culture" that fails to accomplish the goal above. Common pitfalls include:

* **Being an order taker**. The QA job is to *ensure a high-quality* product. That does NOT mean doing all the work themselves. QA should be creating a culture of quality by putting in processes & education that ensure every engineer is also taking quality seriously.
* **Saying 'no' to everything.** QA should help engineering ship _faster_ not slower. The right question to ask is "what is the minimum work we can do to ensure this feature meets the right quality bar?"
* More here later...

## How to use this scorecard

To get the most out of this document you should score yourself on each item, and give yourself a min/max/average on each dimension. Then, ask your manager to do the same \- and maybe peers too. See if they grade you close to how you grade yourself. The goal is to help you go through the [learning cycle](https://web.archive.org/web/10180817212110/http://www.cala.fsu.edu/modules/assessing\_knowledge): ignorance → declarative → procedural → mastery.

Make a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX61irzc6eCxgl1tzEzE6aKF92l7EoHcVac7Nb1Beko/edit\#gid=0) and use the following rating scale:

1. *You’re not doing this and aren’t likely to in the next 6 months.*  
2. *You have significant areas where you need to improve.*  
3. *You do this well.*  
4. *You do this amazingly — keep it up.*  
5. *OMG how do you do this so well???*

  ## How your manager judges you:

1. *Quality: Quality you can taste®*  
   1. *You ensure that work released to production is error-free and you are obsessed with ensuring quality, measured by reducing the Defect Escape Rate. This means catching bugs in the QA process before they become defects in production.*  
   1. *You maximize the likelihood of bug-free code by developing test plans with engineering early in the development cycle.*  
   1. *You are thorough in thinking through real-world user scenarios, seeing what Eng + PM may miss. You frequently come up with test cases nobody else thought of.* 
   1. *You consider risk factors and effectively prioritize test efforts accordingly. You don't waste time testing low-value scenarios.*  
   1. *You use data and metrics to measure the effectiveness of testing efforts and optimize efforts to improve over time.*  

1. *Expertise: you are an undisputed expert on the product*  
   1. *You understand how the product works and should work and the nuances of design tradeoffs taken historically. You understand the inputs and outputs. You can reason through complex scenarios to predict how the product will behave.*  
   1. *You are aware of every change going into the product and ensure that quality is covered on every change (delegation is encouraged\!).*  
   1. *You understand all the metrics that matter for the product and you regularly ask insightful questions and find surprising answers.*  
   1. *You use your expertise proactively to help the organization improve designs and avoid expensive mistakes. You frequently improve the PRD/TDD with your expertise, saving effort in the dev cycle.*
   1. *You can think beyond the current product to the problem that the user is facing, and imagine better solutions than what PM/Eng are proposing.*

1. *Execution/Process: you keep the team executing at peak-performance with minimal (but not too little\!) process*  
   1. *You plug into the various development processes of different teams smoothly, from product definition to daily standups to actual releases. You don't require them to conform to your style.*
   1. *You own the QA part of the development process, developed with input from your stakeholders. You ensure it isn't too heavy & that everyone is following it. Your stakeholders are informed, our customers are happy, and engineers are productive.* 
   1. *You are constantly iterating on how we do testing. You are improving tests, the tools we use, and are working with engineers to automate as much as reasonable.*  
   1. *Your work helps maximize the overall throughput of the engineering team. Engineering time is sacred to you and you don't waste it needlessly. You understand what work needs to be done and the relative importance of everything in the backlog.*  
   1. *You make visible progress on multi-quarter goals on a monthly basis, monthly goals on a weekly basis, weekly goals on a daily basis...*  
 
1. *Team: you raise the bar in a high-performing team and continually improve it*  
   1. *You realize it's not about you. You put the team first in everything you do and your focus is on empowering others.*  
   1. *You are an amazing teacher. Instead of just doing testing yourself you empower engineers to test their own work effectively.*  
   1. *You can go on vacation and the team continues on effectively, relying on the solid practices and principles that you've helped put in place.*  
   1. *Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers alike all love working with you because your work helps them be successful.*  
   1. *You are an effective partner to your EM for building a tribe: the team has fun, loves what they do, and may be friends forever.* 

1. *Leadership*  
   1. *You get buy-in from the engineers, EM/PM, and peers for your QA vision. It aligns well with the company needs, priorities, and appetite.*  
   1. *The other QA team members look up to you and learn from you. They love working with you and improving in their craft.*  
   1. *You manage up effectively. You are high signal-to-noise and escalate when appropriate: bad technical decisions, poor work quality, inappropriate workload, unreasonable technical debt, etc.*  
   1. *You maintain healthy peer relationships with all Engineers, especially Team Leads. You keep them aware of quality concerns and the technical challenges of the QA team, as well as your plans to deal with them.*  
   1. *You are always looking to evolve QA processes and systems in order to deliver the most effectively. You realize the current system will not be the best solution, forever, and that past decisions may be the wrong future direction. You don’t let ego or fear prevent you from catching the next wave: you jump in head-first, learn the implementation, technology, concepts, etc \- and teach your team to do the same.*
