1. **You ensure that your organization _consistently_ executes well.**
    1. Your solid grasp of your organization's _capacity_ and the business’s _needs_ enable you to build a realistic, executable 6-12 month plan. You’ve built the systems needed to handle expected unexpected events like attrition, technical setbacks, etc to still deliver. 
    2. Almost all execution is happening within individual teams. You are no longer involved in the tactics, instead you are working at the operational level. You are improving the team’s execution by helping them _prioritize_, coaching leaders, and training the teams. You manage [via interfaces](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/managing-through-interfaces/).
    3. You increase execution by deploying the big guns your leaders cannot: moving engineers across teams, negotiating complex product/engineering tradeoffs, accelerating hiring, creating/dissolving teams, partnering with other orgs, etc. 
    4. You’ve become a prioritization expert: never overwhelmed, always able to pay attention to the right fire. You know which teams run independently, which ones are sinking and should continue to sink, and where you get maximum leverage. You don’t peanut-butter yourself across too many efforts to be ineffective.
    5. You partner well with up to Sr. Staff ICs to drive larger initiatives across your department. You are very effective at splitting up the soft power/hard power pincer to drive improvements. You get into the technical weeds when necessary, or have someone who can do that for you.
2. **You constantly create _clarity_ up, down, and sideways.**
    1. Your communication is top-notch. You’re deeply aware of the business’s goals and how your organization will contribute: _what_ needs to be shipped, _when_ it needs to be shipped, what the _risks_ are, and how you are _tracking_. You’re a Jedi at making sure everyone who needs to know, knows.
    2. You’ve built the right communication channels in your org so execution problems don’t metastasize _and_ that your time isn’t fully absorbed checking-in on everyone and everything. You are aware of the important and urgent things, but not necessarily everything. You can effectively keep tabs on dozens of parallel projects in just a few hours a week.
    3. You’ve mastered the core communication techniques: broadcasting and 1:1s, public speaking and writing, mission/vision delivery and concrete factual discussions, questioning/probing and directively telling. You adjust seamlessly to achieve clarity.
    4. You’re able to communicate complex technical realities of your organization to non-technical/non-expert stakeholders, especially tradeoffs that help them make informed decisions.
    5. You don’t spend unnecessary energy on communication.
3. **You _align_** **your org to the needs of the business.**
    1. You’ve mastered “[working backwards](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/B088MFRK1H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2GS2150DUXP4H&keywords=think+backwards+amazon&qid=1683069773&s=books&sprefix=think+backwards+amazon%2Cstripbooks%2C143&sr=1-2)” (first principles, top-down, etc) and use it to drive change in your organization as needed. You are _goal oriented_ instead of _activity oriented_ and this reflects by your zealous focus on achieving specific outcomes. 
    2. You actively build a deep understanding of your customers, our business, the domain, our strategy, etc. You make it your own and ensure your teams are making it their own, too.
    3. You are comfortable starting/stopping efforts within your org to maximize aligned results. You aim for global, not local, optimization and never build fiefdoms. Killing pet projects is hard so you do it humanely.
    4. You are the expert in your function and continually educate up and around so the business can make more informed decisions.You are proud of your _technology _roots so you always invest in them.
    5. You think in terms of build / buy / partner / skip to minimize engineering time spent on non-differentiating work.
4. **You build a _healthy_** **org that will outlive you.**
    1. You put active effort into measuring and improving employee engagement and happiness. You truly understand how diversity improves team results and build an environment where all employees feel like they are contributing to the company’s success.
    2. Your hiring game is A+. You make sure to hire _missionaries_ not _mercernaries_. You find both rockstars and superstars. You’ve built a differentiated interview experience that yields great ROI in both numbers and quality of the hires.
    3. You’re amazing at growing Sr. EMs and Staff/Sr. Staff ICs. You use a mixture of coaching, opportunities, formal skills building, and partnerships to build the next bench of talent. You have a succession plan.
    4. You work with your managers to ensure that every engineer, down to the freshest SWE I, continues to learn on the job. You personally put energy into teaching across your org (and the company) - this helps keep you sharp and connected to others.
    5. TODO
5. **You _partner_ with other departments to make your combined output larger than the sum of their parts.**
    1. You are a collaborative, effective partner to other Directors, EMs, PMs, etc. You have a non-hierarchical world view across functions which lets you fluidly build alliances as needed to solve big problems.
    2. You work with other engineering directors/managers directly to improve the overall engineering productivity. You find opportunities for sharing technology, people, goals, etc to move the entire company forward, faster. Remember: no fiefdoms :)
    3. You’ve gotten pretty good at negotiation. You don’t think of the world as zero-sum and instead look for opportunities to grow the pie. You are comfortable giving things away now, and getting more later, if it helps accelerate the company.
    4. You actively partners with the VP of engineering to drive company-level (or cross-department-level) initiatives that improve culture/process/etc. You understand that your first team is other Directors and you effectively solve problems together.
    5. You keep your own organization _accountable _to the commitments you’ve made so you are a good partner. You fall on the sword as needed, or better yet make sure no falling is required. 
6. **You are the foot soldier of the company’s culture machine.**
    1. You live & breath our company’s virtues/values and you encourage others to do so by your example.
    2. You actively create process, celebrations, traditions, ceremonies, etc that reinforce the culture of the company.
    3. You keep the bar high even if it means losing strong performers who aren’t a good cultural fit.
