| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Years of Exp | 0 | 0-2 | 2-5 | 4-8 | 6+ |
|  **Overall Expectations** | **Unsure what good code looks like. Familiar with 1 language.** | **Learning to write good code. Knowledgeable in 1 language.** | **Writes reasonably good code but without thinking about future maintanability. Very strong in 1 language, or knowledgeable in 2.** | **Writes excellent code and has 6-12 month view of maintainability. Expert in 1 language, or very strong in 2.** | **Writes excellent code and has ~2+ years view of maintainability. Very strong in 3 languages or expertise in 1 and very strong in another.** |
|  Correctness | Solves acadamic problems correctly but needs hand-holding to solve real-world problems correctly. Can talk about performance theoretically. | Can solve some real-world problems correctly with no hand-holding; requires extensive hand-holding when problem spans multiple classes or systems. Frequently unaware of performance problems. | Can solve almost all real-world problems correctly; may need hand-holding for complex problems spanning multiple code bases or systems. Performance of code may be occasionally poor. | Can solve all real-world problems correctly. Regularly catches correctness problems via code reviews. almost always gets performance considerations right. | Can solve all real-world problems correctly while also anticipating problems that might arise in the future. Regularly suggests edge-case improvements in code reviews. |
|  Readability | Basic concepts around readability like documentation, variable naming, etc. | Able to follow a language style guide. Readability tends to be poor due to long methods, unclear signatures, catch-all classes, and unorganized file layout. | Good readability at a single class level. Methods and classes are appropriately focused and documented. Can apply the language style guide in code reviews. | Excellent readability at a single-file level (hard to suggest improvements) and solid across classes. Regularly suggests code reorganization across files to keep the entire codebase well-factored. | Can keep code organized across >100KLoC so an entire codebase is readable. Regularly teaches and enforces readability concepts. |
|  Reusability | No real-world understanding of reusability. | Can apply OOP, composition, and DI when requested but doesn't pro-actively use these patterns. | Proactively structures code to be reusable when writing new pieces but does not understand the first-principles behind reusability and doesn't enforce them across a larger code base. | Familiar with OOP design patterns, composition design patterns, standard DI tools/techniques, MVC, etc. Can explain reusability concepts and regularly teaches individuals on the code they are most familiar with. | Expert in reusability and regularly up-levels team members via mentorship. Enforces reusable software across their codebase and tangential codebases. |
|  Testability | Understands unit testing. | Can implement decent unit test, integration tests, etc in existing frameworks. | Can copy existing testing approaches into a new system (unit test frameworks, etc). Tests are well-factored and easy to follow. | Can propose new testing strategies that fit the problem at hand (smoke tests, performance tests, etc). Tests are very reliable and thorough. | Understands the entire universe of testing all the way through QA and what should be used when. Mentors the team and creates new testing frameworks and processes to improve the quality of the software. |

## Architecture Skills

|  Level | New Grad | SWE I | SWE II | Sr. | Staff+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Years of Exp | 0 | 0-2 | 2-5 | 4-8 | 6+ |
|  **Overall Expectations** | **Academic knowledge of architectural design and tradeoffs** | **Basic understanding of architectural design of the system they are working on, but without understanding the why.** | **Good understanding of the architectural design of their system and able to make reasonable, incremental changes to it. They can explain some of the historical tradeoffs.** | **Excellent understanding of at least one architecture they've used and able to propose new, reasonable architectural designs.** | **Excellent understanding of multiple architectures and provide complex tradeoffs for new design problems.** |
|  **SCORES** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|  Correctness | May not be able to identify correctness problems in an architecture. | May not be able to identify correctness problems in an architecture. | Can catch correctness issues in an architecture that they worked on for several years. Starting to understand pieces (CAP theorem, ACID, transactions, PubSub) that impact correctness. | Deeply understand correctness in architecture and are always able to provide designs that guarantee correctness. | Deeply understand the costs of correctness and can provide reliability/cost/speed/etc tradeoffs, in a language understandable up to Product Managers. |
|  Flexibility vs Simplicity | May not be able to distinguish flexible vs inflexible architecture. | May not be able to distinguish flexible vs inflexible architecture. | Can start identifying individual pieces of architecture that improve the overall flexibility of the architecture (e.g. a specific microservice or database table) | Familiar with common components that increase flexibility (databases, queues, RPC, etc) and can fit them together neatly. Sometimes overdesigns unnecessarily complex systems. | Incredibly familiar with all architectural tools for flexibility and can reason from first-principles when a product will need increased flexibility instead of a simpler solution. |
|  Reliability | May not be able to identify reliability problems. | May not be able to identify reliability problems. | Has seen real reliability issues and can identify similar ones in a new architecture. Is able to propose ways to mitigate (architectural changes, monitoring, etc). | Extensive experience with running reliable systems and can proactively identify reliablity issues in a new architecture, even if they've never seen it before. Lots of tools at their disposal to mitigate. | Many, many reliability scars, and enough wisdom to know when over-engineering a reliable solution isn't worth it. Talks in SLOs and has memorized the Google SRE Handbook. |
|  Scalability/Cost | May not be able to reason about scability problems or total cost estimates. | May not be able to reason about scability problems or total cost estimates. | Has seen a few scalability issues and can discuss horizontal vs vertical scaling in specific scenarios. Not familiar with cost estimation. | Has scaled up a system before and seen the nuances required, e.g. data skew or uneven partitions. Can reason about scalability problems from first-principles on a new architecture. Not much insight into cost. | Very comfortable with all types of scalability challenges (stateful systems, stateless systems, data pipelines, etc). Immediately worries about cost and manageability at scale. |

## Domain Skills
Domain skills apply to engineering-specific domains, like frontend engineering, distribute computing, SRE, computer vision,
ML, etc. This is a generic scorecard that should be interpreted for each skill appropriately - e.g. measuring if someone is a
"knowledgeable of most tools/projects in the domain" may be different for a Frontend engineer than an ML engineer. Use this
as a guide and tread with caution for particular roles.

|  Level | New Grad | SWE I | SWE II | Sr. | Staff+ | Principal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
|  **Overall Expectations** | **Never touched the domain** | | **Has worked in the domain for <2 years** | **Has significant exposure (top 40%) to the domain but never been a primary driver** | **Has incredibly high exposure to the domain (top 10%) and driven minor work in the field** | **Has done cutting-edge work in the field (top 1%)** |
|  OSS/tools/etc | Not familiar with any of the common tools or Open Source Software that is part of the domain. | TODO | Some experience with the tools they've used but not aware of the overall space or upcoming solutions. | Very strong user and knowledgeable of most tools/projects in the domain, including new ones as they show up. Go-to person for new employees on the team entering the domain. | Expert user and probably ooccasional contributor to key OSS projects and tools in the domain. Knows where the field is going and can recommend what software to use and what software to avoid. | Key driver of a well-known OSS project or tool in the domain. |
|  Teaching/Mentoring | None | TODO | Can explain basic concepts in the domain and point at resources to learn more. | Understands the domain deeply and regulary mentors new employees on the team in concepts, toolchain, etc. | Has published on company or personal blogs contributions to the domain. May be active in the talk circuit and respected as a knowledgeable person on the subject. | Regularly publishes in the best journals on the domain. |
|  Knowledge | Academic. Has lightly touched the literature and blog posts on the subject. | TODO | Has begun following other experts in the domain via blog posts, Twitter, etc. Doesn't keep up with the cutting-edge knowledge but slowly is expanding their core knowledge of the domain. | Reads all the deeper blog posts and keeps up with influential papers. Can be a resource for others who want to learn more about the cutting-edge of the domain. | Deeply follows all the cutting-edge work and has some personal relationships with the individuals/institutions pushing the domain forward. | Pushes the domain forward. |
|  Application | Needs significant hand-holding to make any progress on solving company problems in the domain. | TODO | Needs to partner with a Medium or High individual on most problems in the domain. Can make significant progress within boundaries laid out by such a partnership. | Can make significant progress against almost all hard problems in the domain for the company. Track-record of using standard tooling/research/OSS to solve key product/technology problems. Partners well with a High individual to scale them up (thought-partner and execution-partner) | Go-to person for solving the hardest problems in this domain at the company. Track record of using cutting-edge research, tools, or OSS in real-world scenarios. De-risks the entire company. | External ambassador of the company to the rest of the world.
