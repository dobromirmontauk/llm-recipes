# Domain Skills
Great engineers stand on the shoulders of giants. They deeply understand the domain they are working on and use this knowledge to avoid reinventing the wheel or tackling a problem from the wrong direction.

Domain skills apply to engineering-specific domains, like frontend engineering, distribute computing, SRE, computer vision,
ML, etc. This is a generic scorecard that should be interpreted for each skill appropriately - e.g. measuring if someone is a
"knowledgeable of most tools/projects in the domain" may be different for a Frontend engineer than an ML engineer. Use this
as a guide and tread with caution for particular roles. I recommend creating domain-specific ladders for any domain where you will hire a lot of engineers (like FE, BE, ML, etc).
