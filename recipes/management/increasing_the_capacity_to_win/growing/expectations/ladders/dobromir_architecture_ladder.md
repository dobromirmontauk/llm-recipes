# Architecture Skills
Good architecture reduces the need for more code. It solves a _class_ of problems by factoring the solution into reusable components that can be reassembled differently, if the problem space changes.

Starting to understand pieces (CAP theorem, ACID, transactions, PubSub) that impact correctness. | Deeply understand correctness in architecture and are always able to provide designs that guarantee correctness.                                                                                                 | Deeply understand the costs of correctness and can provide reliability/cost/speed/etc tradeoffs, in a language understandable up to Product Managers.                               |
| Flexibility vs Simplicity | May not be able to distinguish flexible vs inflexible architecture.         | May not be able to distinguish flexible vs inflexible architecture.                                                   | Can start identifying individual pieces of architecture that improve the overall flexibility of the architecture (e.g. a specific microservice or database table)                       | Familiar with common components that increase flexibility (databases, queues, RPC, etc) and can fit them together neatly. Sometimes overdesigns unnecessarily complex systems.                                   | Incredibly familiar with all architectural tools for flexibility and can reason from first-principles when a product will need increased flexibility instead of a simpler solution. |
| Reliability               | May not be able to identify reliability problems.                           | May not be able to identify reliability problems.                                                                     | Has seen real reliability issues and can identify similar ones in a new architecture. Is able to propose ways to mitigate (architectural changes, monitoring, etc).                     | Extensive experience with running reliable systems and can proactively identify reliablity issues in a new architecture, even if they've never seen it before. Lots of tools at their disposal to mitigate.      | Many, many reliability scars, and enough wisdom to know when over-engineering a reliable solution isn't worth it. Talks in SLOs and has memorized the Google SRE Handbook.          |
| Scalability/Cost          | May not be able to reason about scability problems or total cost estimates. | May not be able to reason about scability problems or total cost estimates.                                           | Has seen a few scalability issues and can discuss horizontal vs vertical scaling in specific scenarios. Not familiar with cost estimation.                                              | Has scaled up a system before and seen the nuances required, e.g. data skew or uneven partitions. Can reason about scalability problems from first-principles on a new architecture. Not much insight into cost. | Very comfortable with all types of scalability challenges (stateful systems, stateless systems, data pipelines, etc). Immediately worries about cost and manageability at scale.    |
