# Expectations
Expectations are what most managers keep hidden in deep, impregnable underground siloes that grind open painfully slowly once a year, during review season, to nuke any last vestige of hope that you might get a raise next year. It's a great approach that gives them optionality and takes very little effort. 

Here, we provide a variety of recipes on how you can set expectations with your engineers. These recipes often become ingredients to other parts of 'Increasing the Capacity To Win', including compensation recipes, coaching recipes, mentorship recipes, etc.
