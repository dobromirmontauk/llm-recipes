# Company-level Expectations
We have expectations that apply to all employees, regardless of their position in the company, their job function, or
their seniority. We expect everyone to reach the _excellent_ bar although we realize some folks may be have trouble passing _OK_.
As long as you are trending towards _excellent_ in at least a few items we love to have you here!

### Company Virtues
Virtues are hard to teach! We screen for them extensively at interview time and do not assume that potential employees
will adjust from a _Poor_ cultural fit. Employees should be learning how to get to _Excellent_ by finding individuals in
at the _Exemplary_ bar and copying their behaviors.

|  Cultural Fit | Poor | OK | Excellent | Exemplary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Overall Expectations** | **DO NOT HIRE/FIRE SOON. Not a cultural fit and incredibly unlikely to become one, ever.** | **WILL NEED COACHING. If strong in other areas very likely they can be taught over 6 months to fit into our culture.** | **CULTURE FIT. They will fit into our culture easily!** | **CULTURE BAR-RAISER. They will enforce our culture on others and spread it to folks in the "OK" category.** |
|  **Scores** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|  Ownership | Makes excuses why things are not done and is constantly surprised by it. Doesn't try to understand the world outside "their borders". Needs babysitting/others taking over their responsibilities. | Doesn't always understand the definition of "done" and over-optimizes for local work vs global impact. When corrected, eager to improve but not comfortable learning about outside "their borders" -- needs pushing. Occasionally surprised when goals slip. | Excellent understanding of "done" and solid understanding of the world outside "their borders". May be uncomfortable stepping into that world when needed and over-relies on others. Not surprised when goals are missed but could have de-risked them more. | Proposes metrics to measure their own success and doesn't have any limitations of what type of work they do (or where they do it) in order to hit the agreed-upon goals. Intelligently distribute ownership to team/others to scale themselves and grow others. |
|  Decisiveness ("hunger') | Always busy but somehow very little useful output appears. Is spinning cycles on the wrong work and is not able to self-correct. Doesn't pay attention to the impact they are having on the team or company. Needs babysitting. | Wants to make progress and have big impact but doesn't always understand how. May get stuck but usually will raise it eventually, albeit later than they should. Unable to distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 decisions. | Usually aware of where the greatest impact can be had and volunteers for that work. Quickly escalates when stuck or blocked. Often able to distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 decisions but still can take longer to decide than ideal. | Always aware of where the greatest impact can be had and gets it done before volunteers are needed. Rarely gets stuck or blocked because proactively working with others to avoid that. Quickly decides Type 2 decisions and carefully decides Type 1. |
|  Humble | Wants to always be the smartest person in the room. Over-emphasizes their own impact while poo-pooing their colleagues. | Comfortable sharing credit but still needs that ego boost. Occasionally falls back to "smartest person in the room" but does feel bad about it afterwards. | Very comfortable sharing credit or even giving it entirely to others. Quick to call out others when put in the spotlight. | Works largely in the background to make sure the spotlight is landing on those who need it more than them. Truly believes that they can only succeed by hiring people smarter than them and feels deeply uncomfortable when not so surrounded. |
|  Empathy ("people-smart") | [Blind to the needs and contributions of others. May be a Heretics or Prophet of Rage; both are destructive and require a lot of coaching.](https://a16z.com/2014/11/05/the-prophets-of-rage-2/ "Blind to the needs and contributions of others. May be a Heretics or Prophet of Rage; both are destructive and require a lot of coaching.") | Aware of needs of others but hasn't grokked that team > self. Helps others when asked instead of proactively and can't quite predict where others might be needing them. | Starting to care more about others than self and demonstrates it by regularly letting the sexy work go to other team members. Starting to notice the needs of others and proactively deal with them. | Gets all satisfaction from the output of the team (vs the self) and constantly optimizes for keeping the team humming. Has developed a sixth-sense for the needs of others and proactively brings them up and helps solve them, to the surprise of those helped. |
|  Intellectual Honesty | Changes their message based on the audience in incompatible ways. Regularly avoids conflict and disagreements. Frequently has negative opinions that will be shared with everyone except the individual who needs to hear it. | Uncomfortable challenging authority (real or perceived) and uncomfortable being wrong publicly (but OK privately). Occasionally values harmony over truth and avoids raising issues that may cause disagreements. Has difficulty providing bad news or negative feedback. May be on opposite side of the scale: honest without regards to the consequences of the message or delivery. | Comfortable challenging authority, status quo, and team with well-thought out concerns. Doesn't overdo it. Values getting hard feedback and having their own ideas challenged. Admits when they are wrong publicly, humbly. | Is able to do all of the previous ones while maintaining a positive team atmosphere and not (unnecessarily) hurting any egos. |
TODO(dmontauk): call out our "Bar Raisers" here so new employees know what we mean!

### Collaboration
We are a distributed company that lives & dies by how well our individuals and teams collaborate. Success is a team
effort! 

|   | Unacceptable | Poor | OK | Excellent | Exemplary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Overall Expectations** | **Numerous examples of failing to collaborate effectively despite receiving feedback and coaching** | **Has not developed good collaboration skills or habits but may be able to do so** | **Is able to work effectively with a team.** | **Strong team player in their primary team.** | **Strong team player across the organization and able to help peers at L3 reach L4 in collaboration.** |
|  **Scores** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|  Team Communication | Withholds information that might help the group (accidentaly or on purpose), even when probed. Doesn't absorb information that is communicated through regular team channels (email/chat/JIRA/etc). | Does not prioritize communicating relevant information to stakeholders but is able to do so when requested. May not absorb information from team proactively but is able to do so when requested. | Generally understands what is happening on their team (usually not beyond) and uses this to adjust their work. Able to communicate relevant information (usually only through regular channels or "up" to TL or manager). | Very in-tune with everything happening on their team and starting to pay attention to teams beyond. Has developed intuition on how to be high signal-to-noise in their communication and starting to know whom to include in what messages. | Has mastered both the communication medium (balancing between 1:1, meetings, PRs, docs, etc to maximize information transferred while minimizing time/distraction) and the audience (notifying the right people at the right time, and NOT distracting the wrong people at the wrong time). |
|  Reliability | Makes commitments they have no intention on hitting, often to end the conversation so they can go back to their pet project. Does not realize they missed on their promise until called out on it, and even then often shrug it off. Teammates are actively avoiding asking individual for help. | Feels uncomfortable making commitments on what will get done or does not take their implicit commitments seriously. Regularly misses them (e.g. sprint goals) and does not communicate until after the fact. Might make excuses on why they failed to accomplish what they said they would. | Generally accomplishes the work they set out to do >50% of the time although slippage occurs regularly. May not be obvious they will miss the commitment until last possible moment, and when asked, most likely they just didn't focus on it and "things just slipped." May not be able to prioritize work across their team and cross-team needs yet. | Makes clear commitments (what will be delivered, when) which are well-documented and hits them 80% of the time (95% with slippage). Able to commit to both primary team and across teams. Shares bad news early if commitment might slip. | Makes crystal-clear commitments and hits them 95% of the time (99% with slippage). Documentation is almost not needed because employee is as good as their word. Asks for help when commitment is slipping and takes personal responsibility (e.g. working over time, running postmortems, etc). |
|  Gets Commitments | Does not explicitly ask other peers to commit to specific work or goals and then complains that no one is willing to help. | Feels uncomfortable asking peers to make commitments and even more uncomfortable holding them accountable. May shoulder more work on themselves instead of asking for help because of this. | Implicitly understands commitments and asks teammates for help/to get things done. May not yet understand the need to document and hold peers accountable. Often ends up surprised when commitments were misunderstood and slip. May get very frustrated when peers miss commitments instead of introspecting what they could have done differently. | Understands the importance of commitments and regularly gets them from peers, although they may not be able to suss out how realistic they actually are. May over-document and over-process commitments which provides great visibility but too much friction. Regularly checks-in on their commitments and holds peers accountable for slipping. | Understands people's capabilities and reliability and uses this to effectively get commitments that lets them make reliable commitments on top! Digs into people's commitments to make sure they are realistic and understood by peer. Documents appropriately (not too often, not too rarely). Holds peers accountable for slipping and also goes over & above by finding ways to make them not slip. |
