# Overview

This document describes how to implement a short version of the Twitter Leadership Training class we did over 3 days
called “TWIG”. A summary of TWIG, intended to eventually be turned into an instruction manual for launching leadership
programs, is
available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSvUvwecb4Zu-cgHpG48sz3okWfCfTXqFTSNKkpw2no/edit#heading=h.77m3618k6zkm) (
but is not formatted for general consumption). This document is less ambitious, more action-oriented, and easy to
implement for folks that want to get their feet wet with leadership programs.

I hate the world “leadership” because it usually conflates two very different skill sets: _management_ and _being an
agent of change_. Management is the art of optimizing a group of people and processes that are mostly working well. An
agent of change is the art of _leaving_ the “mostly working” path in search of a better, more global optimization. There
is inherent tension between these two roles and great leaders must be able to gracefully switch back and forth - and be
clear about what they are doing, and why. Both skills are life-long learning paths and cannot be fully taught in 3 days,
let alone 4 hours.

The goal of TWIG was to _open people’s eyes_ to the importance of strong leadership skills, in both dimensions, to
transform groups of individuals into high-performing teams. It also attempted to reveal the “next steps” that each
individual could take in these growth paths so the learnings were not theoretical. Our 4-hour version only attempts to
create that spark of understanding and leaves all follow-up out-of-scope. We assume that it is being run by a
facilitator(s) that works closely with these individuals and who can follow-up outside this agenda.

# Program Design

So how do you create a “spark of understanding” about the importance of leadership in 4 hours?

Engineers have certain patterns that we’re taking advantage of to make the program effective:

1. Engineers are skeptical. They are extra-skeptical about non-engineering things, like leadership and “people”.
2. Engineers hate to fail, especially on problems that seem easy. Good engineers have learned to confront failure by
   learning with retros, introspection, etc.
3. Engineers like to learn by iterating and experimenting. If they find something better via their own experience (not
   word-of-mouth) they will often enthusiastically adopt it.
4. Engineers, as a population, have a lower EQ distribution than the norm. They often appreciate being more explicit
   about how people feel, discussing behaviors, etc.

With this in mind, we’ve designed the program to be mostly experiential: exercises done in groups that require both
aspects of leadership, and that fail if poor leadership is displayed. We use retros during and after the exercises to
spark conversations and, hopefully, self-reflection. We also provide a few tools before & during the exercises to give
shared language to describe individuals’ experiences and make behaviors an explicit topic of discussion.

Sparks cannot be engineered, unfortunately. The “shotgun” approach of TWIG yielded 1% “oh my god, you’ve changed my
life” feedback, 10% “this was very important to me” feedback, and >80% “this was useful” feedback. This is a much
shorter exercise so the results may not be that strong either. To help maximize the likelihood of success we recommend
focusing the energy on people who are “near the cusp” of understanding. In Engineering, these are usually Sr+ folks who
are starting to struggle with scaling themselves beyond 2-3 fellow engineers. By Staff+ the majority of the work might
be leadership and these individuals tend to be very ripe to such classes. The most senior ones can be used as
facilitators or to spark conversations within the groups themselves, even if they aren’t learning as much anymore.

That said, we’ve seen junior people go through these classes and be VERY influenced coming out. So your mileage may
vary.

# Details

## Pre-read

For this 4-hour session we recommend all attendees read _5 Dysfunctions of a Team_ and fill out the survey for their
_work team_. They will use this to discuss with their new teams.

## Core Team Formation

Create 3-4 teams of 4-6 people. Minimum teams needed is 3 for the Blind Squares exercise but 4 gives you a more
realistic simulation. 4 individuals per team is also the minimum for Blind Squares, although 5+ makes the exercise a
little more fun + difficult.

Teams should be somewhat random. Ideally people not working with each other regularly. You can design the teams if you
want to put people together that will benefit from discussing team dynamics and leadership.

To help with team formation, ask the teams to spend 10 minutes answering the following question and discussing them as a
team:

1. Discuss your _5 Dysfunctions_ survey results that you did before attending. What is one area you’d like to get better
   at during this offsite?
2. Come up with a team name.

## Blind & Mute Number Sort

**Summary: **each individual is assigned a number and the entire group is put in a random line and must sort themselves.

**Motivation**: this is an incredibly simple exercise to do if a single person was making all the decisions. It shows
how solving problems across an organization is rarely due to the "technical" challenge and is largely about reaching "
alignment" with others in the organization.

**Dynamics: **what usually happens is that each Core Team is able to come up with a reasonable approach to sorting the
numbers within 15 minutes. Having pen & paper helps a lot for visual thinkers. Often, there is a dominant voice in the
group, but this works OK since with a small number that can often be productive. When we bring the small groups together
into the large group we’ve always seen chaos ensue: the loud voices try to drown each other out. Everyone is focused on
_solving the problem_ and very few people are focused on _how do we get this group of people to agree on the process_?
Those people are usually ignored, the group flounders and rushes, and when sorting begins it’s somewhat chaotic. \
\
Even groups that manage to self-organize rarely find _all the best ideas_ and end up missing some edge-cases in the
exercise. Facilitators can help the group come to the realization that the answer was there, somewhere, and that the
group failed to extract all the human capital it had. \
**Core leadership training**:

* identifying that the problem is group organization, not the problem itself
* Helping everyone have equal voices
* Breaking down the problem into pieces that can be delegated by sub-team
* Setting clear goals against concrete timelines

**Material needed**:

1. Post-it notes with numbers written down, one per individual participating. You want to make the numbers
   unpredictable: use fractions, decimal numbers, negative numbers, infinity, numbers very close to each other, etc.
2. Blindfolds, one per person.
3. Large writing pads so teams can draw/write down what they want to communicate.

**Flow**: 100 minutes

1. Organizing phase:
    1. 5 minutes to explain the exercise. Read the statement below verbatim.
    2. Split into Core Teams.
    3. 15 minutes for Core Teams to come up with a plan.
        1. Core teams discuss task and come up with strategies.
    4. Core Teams join as Full Team.
    5. 20 minutes for the Full Team to organize.
        2. Groups come together and discuss strategies.
2. Optional, if time permits and the situation needs it:
    6. Interrupt the 20-minute “Full Team” discussion at the halfway mark if they are going off the rails. Start a live
       retro: what is going on, what is working, what isn’t working, how are they going to be ready to execute in the
       next 10 minutes?
3. Execution phase:
    7. 10 minutes to blindfold people, place in a line, and assign numbers randomly.
    8. 10 minutes to sort the line.
    9. 5 minutes to measure results.
4. Retrospective phase:
    10. 10 minutes as Core Team, with Team Facilitator.
        3. Qs
            1. Did anyone feel that they had a good idea that didn’t get heard?
            2. Did anyone……
    11. 15 minutes as Full Team, with Lead Facilitator.
    12. 5 minutes every individual answers (privately) the following 4 questions:
        4. What was one thing I did that helped the group achieve the desired result?
        5. What was one thing that I should have done, but did not, to help the group?
        6. What is one thing that I did that may have hindered the group in achieving the desired result?
        7. What is one thing outside my comfort zone that I’d like to try next time?

**Measurement**:

* Time to complete the sort (if &lt;10 minutes).
* # of errors in the sort (pair-wise replacements needed?)

**Constraints**:

* Organization phase: none.
* Execution phase: mute & blind.

**Facilitators**:

* One lead facilitator to oversee clock, phases, etc.
* Two facilitators to help blindfolding and randomizing the line.
* Facilitator role:
    * Core team planning
        * Facilitators observing, taking notes(are there actions that can be matched to dysfunctions?),
        * Discussing what we’re seeing in real time.

**Other thoughts**: would it be helpful for the team to try it again if they failed the first time and had their
retrospective?

## Blind Squares

**Summary: **There are 4 teams. There is 1 management team and 3 ‘engineering’ teams.** **The engineering teams have a
long rope (tied at the ends) that they must form into a square and then place on TOP of 50% of each other square, while
blindfolded. Because the teams start off far away from each other this exercises “remote work” where teams are pretty
unaware of other teams’ progress. Communication needs to be deliberate and concise, which is hard for most people.

**Dynamics**: Teams have usually learned from the former exercise through the retro and try to incorporate their
lessons. Since there is more flexibility in communication they often resort to breaking down the problem ahead of time,
they create a management group (usually the team with no rope) to oversee the process, and they have explicit time
checks.  \
\
This all helps dramatically but isn’t enough. Since this exercise simulates remote work with expensive communication
channels, most teams over rotate to top-down management. Individual groups with the actual ropes are not able to make
progress independently. Sometimes the management team is “overthrown” and the groups execute without them. Sometimes the
management team makes everything slower or even undoes useful work that has been completed. In all of these cases,
facilitators should note the dynamics that are leading up to those decisions and help the group reflect on them.

In this exercise it can help to pull out people who are underutilized (not holding a rope) and take off their blindfolds
to be “silent observers”. Their job is just to watch what is happening and then help the retro go better. They can even
be placed back into their teams later - their extra knowledge is rarely capitalized by the entire team, which is an
interesting phenomenon worth discussing.

Again, groups tend to spend too much time solving the problem and not enough time figuring out how all the 3 teams will
come together after they’ve made their squares. This “integration complexity” is common in engineering and worth
pointing out.

**Core Leadership Training**:

* Thinking ahead of time about the integration approach
* Designing a communication structure for remote teams that is effective
* Finding a balance between top-down management and bottoms-up execution
* Rolling up your sleeves when necessary - avoiding “over-leadership”

**Material needed**:

1. 3 long ropes of 12m each.
2. Blindfolds, one per person.
3. A large, open area where people have space to maneuver for the exercise. A field with grass works best so there is
   less risk of tripping and falling, but a parking lot can be used in a pinch.

**Flow**: 100 minutes

1. Organizing phase:
    1. 10 minutes to prep the exercise.
        1. Read the statement below verbatim.
        2. Keep the ropes hidden so people don’t know what they are dealing with. Answer any questions.
        3. Separate the Core Teams apart far enough so they can hear each other if shouting, but can discuss in person
           as needed.
        4. Have everyone blindfold themselves and place the rope in the middle of the circle of 3 of each team.
    2. Unlike Number Sort, there is no separate organizing/execution phase in small teams. This is to mimic real life a
       little bit better.
2. 40 minutes for the team to organize/execute however they want, per the instructions.
    3. (optional) at the 20-minute mark, pause the exercise and run a retro if things are not going well. See Retro
       instructions below.
3. Retrospective phase:
    4. 15 minutes as Core Team, with Team Facilitator.
    5. 15 minutes as Full Team, with Lead Facilitator.
    6. 5 minutes every individual answers (privately) the following 4 questions:
        5. What was one thing I did that helped the group achieve the desired result?
        6. What was one thing that I should have done, but did not, to help the group?
        7. What is one thing that I did that may have hindered the group in achieving the desired result?
        8. What is one thing outside my comfort zone that I’d like to try next time?

## Number Sort

Welcome to Lodex! You are all part of a hot Silicon Valley startup tackling one of the HARDEST problems known to
computer science: sorting numbers. You’ve raised tens of millions of $ on the promise that you have a new, distributed
algorithm that takes those pesky computers out of the equation. That’s right, your approach will depend entirely on
humans, just like all those other ML startups out there. The wrinkle: not only did the founders not have the final
product ready when raising their Seed, they actually hired all of you to go figure out that algorithm. And we only have
a little time left before we run out of money.

Our world-class product & design teams have done a ton of customer discovery and came back with the following
requirements. These are NOT flexible because an overzealous marketing team already put out a press release before
checking-in with engineering:

1. Our macroprocessors, i.e. all of you, will be arranged in a line.
2. Each macroprocessor will get a random, single number on a sticky note. These CANNOT be shown to anyone else.
3. Everyone will be blindfolded during the sorting of the numbers.
4. No known language can be used during the actual sorting of the numbers. Sound is acceptable.
5. No information about the actual input numbers was gathered during discovery. Sorry.
6. Numbers must be sorted in less than 10 minutes.

We have about 35 minutes before our investors want to see this algorithm in action. Spend 15 minutes in your small teams
discussing the algorithm, how you will execute it, etc. Then, spend 20 minutes as a group however you’d like to get
ready to execute. I will be the time keeper.

Any questions?

## Blind Squares

Lodex managed to survive its first debacle and grow into a successful Series A startup. The team has gelled quite a bit
started researching their Next Big Thing. After months of playing golf, I mean visiting customer sites, our Product &
Design team have come up with a more visual experience for customers. They are certain now that this is EXACTLY what
they need and already redesigned the website with this new product in mind.

1. Lodex must take 3 ropes, tied at the ends, turn them into squares, and position them on the ground so every square
   covers AT LEAST 1 other square EXACTLY 25%.
2. The ropes must be fully extended.
3. The quality of the product will be judged on the accuracy of the corners, extension of the ropes, and overlapping %.
4. The product team is still absolutely certain this needs to be done blindfolded. That scores very highly in customer
   research.

The VP of Engineering is excited to try out some new ideas that have been permeating his team. In particular, everyone
learned from Number Sort that waterfall planning is dangerous and has convinced the whole company that Agile and
continuous delivery is The Only Way. They’ve built 3 autonomous teams to execute multiple company priorities in parallel
and the VP of Eng promised the CEO they are ready for the next challenge. He forgot to run this by his team of course,
but he’s certain they will rise to the occasion.

1. The VP has decided to give every eng team 1 rope.
2. He’s put together a management team to help coordinate across the 3 execution teams.
3. Because of COVID, teams have become more distributed as people moved away from HQ. We will start with each team
   separated by about 10m. (Facilitators will help you move around to keep folks safe)
4. We were able to afford Zoom by re-using people’s logins, so folks are now allowed to talk to each in any way they
   want.

Our website is going live in 40 minutes and we need a demo ready for the press. You can use that time in any way you
want, as long as we have the squares built by the end.

Any questions?
