# Background
This is an email I wrote to a departing employee. It captures some of the message I'd been sharing with him for a few months before. I'm publishing this since actual examples of difficult feedback are hard to come by. 

Why did I write this email? The employee was already departing. It wasn't going to provide any value to my company. But I still felt like I had a responsibility to grow them, and that perhaps this final nudge would save them (and others) a lot of heartache in the future. 
# The email
Subject: Your career…

Dear [EMPLOYEE],

Thank you for all you’ve done for [COMPANY] over the last few years. I’ll be eternally grateful for the blood, sweat, and tears you put into this company. Truly, I wish you success wherever you go.

I hope this one piece of advice helps you with that.

You need to internalize feedback better. 

I’ve seen many occasions where you take feedback at the “surface” level instead of the “fundamental” level. This happened again last week. I gave you feedback that you didn’t succeed in keeping your engineers productive & happy which is one of the main jobs of an engineering manager. Your response to my feedback was stating that your time prioritization was wrong, that you were too busy, and going forward you’d put more attention on it. Since feedback is about observed behaviors this is a natural response: “well, if I changed this behavior, I would have been successful… So let me go work hard on changing it.”

But… This is a **trap**. Don’t fall into it. Feedback is about behaviors because, well, that’s all the rest of us can see. It’s like someone seeing you limping or with a high fever and pointing it out. Sure, you’ll do a little better if you grab some crutches and an aspirin. You’ll be a more successful engineering manager if you add “keep my engineers productive & happy” up high into your prioritization list. But that is focusing on the _symptoms_ and not the _root cause_. Treating symptoms is **incredibly inefficient** because they just keep coming back! Engineers who believe they are incorporating feedback by trying different behaviors end up overwhelmed by the list of things they need to “do differently.”

Instead: change your _mindset_. 

Our behaviors arise naturally from what we believe to be true and how our mind reacts to new information. Our mental models of the world are _always_ slightly wrong and sometimes very wrong. At best, they are an approximation and we must constantly change them. This is what I meant by “improve how you think” in my training. When someone provides feedback on your behaviors ask yourself: “_why_ did I behave that way? What would I need to believe is true, which I don’t today, to behave the _opposite_ way?”

If you can’t identify the mindset that the feedback is actually referring to, _then ask_. Find the root cause of the symptom. You need to be the “doctor of your mind” since nobody else can do that for you. We can all help by providing more example behaviors (symptoms) and you need to find the pattern that leads you to the mindset that needs to shift. Once you’ve found it - propose it to the giver of feedback and see if it resonates.

I was hoping that working with [MANAGER] you would get regular feedback on your behaviors and hands-on coaching on how to shift your mindset. You have a lot of work to do and need someone willing to invest in challenging you, probably for many years, to unlock your full potential. Please, look for this in your next manager. **The biggest career risk you are running is the “it’s not me, it’s them…” mindset.** You are already deep into this as shown by your latest Slack message: “But the discussions that i had with you and wt made me realize that the commitment is from one side only.” This is such a common failure mode that I also had a slide on it:

You are looking for “extrinsic” signs of commitment: more money, title, responsibility, etc. That’s not how growth-oriented organizations work. They give you “intrinsic” signs of commitment: mentorship to support you, the right level of challenge to prove yourself, and feedback to stretch you. We’ve explained to you many times how we are doing this for you. The money, titles, and responsibility follow once you’ve earned it.

You’ve told me many times that you are growth-oriented. Your behaviors have always suggested that you are not sure what growth really is. Maybe this email will help somewhat. 

Learn to incorporate feedback. Update your mindset. Expand your views. Nothing can stop you then. 

Yours truly,

Dobromir


# Draft Notes
The email above took me a long time to write. I went through several drafts & lots of different ideas. I'm sharing some of those rough notes below to illustrate the writing process. We rarely get to observe the actual process of creation in writing -- we just get the final product. Just like coding, it's messy, imperfect, iterative. Probably more so. I'm hoping that this entire Git repo (with the commit history!) shows how hard it is to get to something that is actually useful. So, don't despair if you feel stuck :)

## The notes

I was 100% committed to you

If you are growth-oriented, a “commitment” from us would look like 

Our commitment to growing you was 100% - that’s literally why I kept you reporting to [MANAGER]. And we asked for your commitment to grow yourself - i.e. mindset shifts. 

Ask yourself: “This will exemplify itself as more empathy, better communication skills, an ability to see the future. It all starts with, “why do I think this way? What do I believe is true? What what happen if I believed the opposite was true?” It stretches the mind. 

It’s like a doctor treating a high fever with aspirin. 

You were too busy because you didn’t truly understand what “winning” meant and spent time on low-leverage activities. Or because you 

It starts by realizing the _mindset_ shift you need, which then leads to a _behavior_ shift. 

Trying isn’t enough. Working hard isn’t enough. I reward people who succeed, and you didn’t. 

I hope you had a good break and had a chance to reflect on 202X as you go into 202Y. There was one thing you said in our last 1:1 of the year which I’ve been reflecting on. It was something to the effect of “I’ll put this decision behind me, move forward.” I realized I didn’t know what kind of “move forward” you were referring to. Will you put the past behind you and try to not let it weigh you down? Or will you stare deeply into your behaviors that led to my decision and learn from the failure? Which fork in the road you pick will greatly affect the rest of your career so I’m sending this hoping it helps you pick the right one.

“Listening to others” has been one of the big categories of feedback you’ve received from peers since the beginning. Go back and read the first and second reviews. Some quotes that should weigh deeply on you:



* He becomes opinionated very early. “You need to go and find out…” “You should do this…” It’s hard to have an open discussion with him; he is biased very early. He thinks he is teaching the person in front of him. Instead of listening. Room for open discussion is completely missing.
* I get the impression - maybe because [EMPLOYEE] built [PRODUCT] - but I get the feeling that he rules out a lot of possibilities in his mind. For [PRODUCT] spec: we have a requirement to attach the screenshots. We have a lot of options, [REDACTED]... I think [EMPLOYEE] immediately ruled that out in his mind. He wasn’t very opening to discussing that.
* I’ve worked with everyone on the engineering team on some level. He is an exception, not in a positive sense, in communication. I haven’t felt this with anyone else at [COMPANY]. It’s very hard for everyone to talk to him and work effectively with him.

You frequently communicate from **your perspective** instead of the perspective of **your audience**. This leads to the feeling of “[EMPLOYEE] doesn’t hear my perspective” which leads to frustration working with you. **This is the one thing for you to work on in the next year**. You should constantly ask yourself: “Am I understanding their view? How will my reply be interpreted? What will be the reactions of the other person?”

[EMPLOYEE-REPORT]’s performance review is a recent example. It felt written for _you_, not for _her_. It didn’t have the tone and examples that would encourage her to improve her performance. It also contained broad allegations without supporting evidence which felt very confrontational. I had to ask [MANAGER] to help you improve it because, as written, it may have really distressed her. An older example was your own self-performance review. The original version had a lot of fingerpointing and chest-thumping; how do you think your peers would have interpreted that type of document? 

A risk you run is interpreting this feedback as “I need to slightly adjust my communication style.” You might actually need to experience a radical reshuffling of your core values. I’m guessing this since I went through something similar at Google. I can share the story in person; the brief version is I got a huge shock to my system during a 3-day leadership class. My approach then was “get to the answer & the goal no matter what”; what happened was I steamrolled 20 other individuals and they were very upset at me afterwards. I learned you can’t lead if no one is willing to follow. I’ve spent years rewiring my value system to care less about _being right_ and care more about _being effective_. For me, it was a mindset problem, not a skills problem.

Don’t put the events from 202X behind you too quickly. Don’t run away from the feedback. Learn from this experience. Reflect on what you tried and why it didn’t work. Get coaching from [MANAGER]. Seek advice from your peers. Come talk to me when you need guidance. If you can find and eliminate this blind spot it will be an inflection point in your career. 

Yours, TRULY,

Dobromir

Talk Track



* We discussed success in the role very clearly in your performance review a year ago:
    * “To succeed in this role he’s going to have to become a master manager, delegator, communicator, talent magnet, and talent grower.”
* I called out the critical path:
    * **His peers and reports are becoming frustrated at how hard it is to collaborate with [EMPLOYEE].**
    * **“**As [EMPLOYEE] transitions into more of a management role he will sink or swim by his growth in this skillset. 202X will be a pivotal year.”
    * I’ve worked with everyone on the engineering team on some level. He is an exception, not in a positive sense, in communication. I haven’t felt this with anyone else at [COMPANY]. It’s very hard for everyone to talk to him and work effectively with him.
    * Progress module with [PEER]: we are ~4 months in and still haven’t built it.
