Subject: Announcing My Summer Temporary Leave

Back in 2019, when [CEO] and I were choosing to work together, I shared my professional goals with him. These included ‚Äúusing technology to remove obstacles from civilization‚Äôs hardest problems‚Äù (construction certainly qualifies!), ‚Äústrong peer team that has an unfair advantage through their skills & knowledge‚Äù (yup we‚Äôve got this!), and ‚Äúproblem size, commitment from team, and runway for 10+ years of solving this together‚Äù (our commitment to the mission is definitely top-notch).

[CEO] asked me about any personal goals. I was a little reluctant to share this with him since he still hadn‚Äôt offered me the job‚Ä¶ but I did tell him that I wanted to take an ‚Äúaround the world‚Äù trip with my kids when they were a little older. That‚Äôs when I learned how supportive he was of family commitments and cemented my decision that [COMPANY] was the right fit. Wow, 4 years can go by fast! It‚Äôs been a thrilling roller coaster (occasionally a little too thrilling) and my kids have suddenly turned into big boys - the older one is suddenly a teenager (!). I realized last year that my window for the kids wanting to spend time with their ol‚Äô dad might be closing and [CEO] agreed this summer was a possibility. We feel confident now that the engineering team is executing in the right direction and [COMPANY] can afford my absence for a couple of months.

During these discussions, we also decided that for those 2 months we should have an interim Head of Engineering. **[NEW HOE]** will be assuming the responsibilities during my absence. This will ensure that the team has a clear decision maker. Because the next few months will largely be focused on data products and Annotation automation, [NEW HOE] has the right depth to navigate complex decisions. He has [CEO]‚Äôs and my full confidence and blessing to make any choices he deems necessary in the role. Until my sabbatical starts, [NEW HOE] and I will be working to prepare him for the job and I plan on being available during the time off for advice whenever necessary.

My leave dates will be **June 11th-August 13th**. We are going to be spending 3 weeks traveling in [REDACTED]. I will be mostly offline while actively traveling, although available for emergencies with a 24 hour notice. My phone number (---) should work, as will my WhatsApp, which will be the best way to reach me. I‚Äôll be back in the office on August 14th, fully refreshed - or glad to escape a couple of young rascals ;) 

Like anyone entering a new role, even temporarily, [NEW HOE] will need everyone‚Äôs support. I‚Äôm really looking forward to my return and seeing what unexpected improvements [NEW HOE] has rolled out üôÇ



# Expectations

Nothing can fully prepare you for a new role, even an interim one. The #1 expectation I have is that you do your best, keep your head straight, and get help/listen to feedback from [HEAD OF PRODUCT], [CEO], Justin, and your other peers. We all want you to succeed (for our sake and yours!). 

I have a Scorecard [below](#heading=h.qox3jnol9ww8) that has these expectations summarized. 


## CEO

You will be reporting to [CEO] for the next 2 months. Usually, [CEO] takes new reports very seriously and puts energy into building a strong relationship. This is a special case though and he politely requested that we understand he won‚Äôt be able to focus that type of energy. Any coaching, feedback, etc should mostly come from [HEAD OF PRODUCT] + me (see training plan below). Reporting to a CEO is a very different experience; they are incredibly busy, they focus on the #1 company problem (which ideally is NOT your department!), and they expect you to be on top of things. A long time ago my coach told me this, and I have it in front of me every day:

**Executive Role: My boss has confidence that I have things under control.**

When I asked Wade once what kind of performance reviews I should expect from my CEO, he laughed and said ‚Äúif you haven‚Äôt been fired, then you are meeting his expectations.‚Äù The CEO is not there to solve your problems or provide empathy. He is not there to coach you. He is not there to fill in your gaps. While s/he might do some of those things, the CEO really only has one main job: to keep you accountable. It‚Äôs your job to keep things under control. That means you should expect tough questions in 1:1s or Staff meetings. You might even feel ‚Äúbeat up‚Äù sometimes - that‚Äôs the job. The way you know they respect you and value your contributions: you are still sitting at the table. 

Engineering is a special type of department in a tech company. It‚Äôs _the most expensive _and also _the hardest to keep accountable_. This makes it a big, black, scary box for CEOs. An incredibly important part of the job is to communicate up the _right level of information _so the box is less scary (‚Äúconfidence that I have things under control‚Äù). I think this might be challenging for you: I still find that you occasionally are too detailed, or too circumspect, in group settings. **This will quickly erode trust in an executive group, as will withholding information that‚Äôs material**. You will have to work to find a balance and listen to the room. Don‚Äôt be surprised if [CEO], [HEAD OF PRODUCT], or others push back, and _definitely_ don‚Äôt get defensive if that happens; that‚Äôs the one reaction that can kill the working relationship.


## Product

For these 2 months, [HEAD OF PRODUCT] will be your peer. The Product/Eng relationship is one of the most important in keeping our execution healthy. [HEAD OF PRODUCT] and I respect each other greatly and use that deep trust to challenge each other. I would like that dynamic to be transferred over so I‚Äôve asked [HEAD OF PRODUCT] not to go soft on you; similarly, I‚Äôd like to see you quickly become an effective negotiation partner with him. The most important part of the relationship is the _mindset_: Engineering is _not_ your 1st Team. The Exec Group (especially [HEAD OF PRODUCT] + Justin) is your 1st Team - these are the people you need to solve problems with. Engineering is your 2nd Team - the _tool_ you use to solve the problems [COMPANY] needs solved.

I‚Äôve found using this mindset helps me be much more in a problem-solving mode when working with Product and become less defensive overall. If (when?) [HEAD OF PRODUCT] criticizes Engineering, he is not criticizing _my team_ - he is criticizing one of the tools we have available to solve our problems, and I should consider his criticism seriously. I don‚Äôt know if the same mindset would be useful to you, or if you have another approach, but the expectation remains the same. Keep the Product/Eng relationship healthy.


## Engineering

It might be strange that I didn‚Äôt start the Expectations section with the Engineering department, which you will be responsible for. That‚Äôs because a Head of Eng role is different from most Director-level roles: managing _up_ and _sideways_ is equal, or sometimes more important, than managing _down. _ A lot can go wrong in the interface between Engineering and the business. Since that will be new to you, I started with that.

The expectations on the engineering side will look familiar: maintain a high execution velocity, high morale, and a good balance between short-term goals and long-term maintainability. The summer months will be critical because we‚Äôll (hopefully) be executing the Owner Dashboard as fast as we can. We‚Äôll also need to make significant strides on our ML progress, and if Factory Annotation hasn‚Äôt hit the efficiency targets that‚Äôll be yet another high-priority problem. Balancing between all these priorities will stretch your abilities; delegation and interface-level management are key.

You should expect to only have bandwidth to handle _one_ priority at a time, and possibly 1-2 fires. Time-wise, plan on ~20% of your time going into overhead, 40% into ‚Äúfires‚Äù, and 40% into the priority you choose. Keep control of your calendar: kicking back problems that won‚Äôt become fires for 2 more weeks (or 4, or until dB is back‚Ä¶) is a key skill to maintaining sanity. 

**You have full authority to act in the capacity of Head of Engineering**. This includes reorganizing the team, firing, hiring (if we have headcount), etc. All of this should be done within the usual constraints of the business and our practices, of course. It should also be done in consultation with [HEAD OF PRODUCT] and [CEO], which is how I would approach it anyhow. 


### Attrition

Engineering is running _really close_ to the red-line. We have multiple SPOF that would seriously hamper our ability to hit any goals. Possibly your #1 goal is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lose anybody.‚Äù You should prioritize information-gathering, skip-level 1:1s, and leaning on [HEAD OF TALENT] for a sense of the mood. If you have any warning signs on individuals please immediately bring this to the attention of [CEO]; don‚Äôt wait until the next meeting.


### [PEER]

It‚Äôs always somewhat awkward to have a peer become a direct report. It‚Äôs doubly-awkward if it‚Äôs a temporary situation. As part of your homework, I want you to think through how you‚Äôre going to navigate this and have a coaching session with me about it.
