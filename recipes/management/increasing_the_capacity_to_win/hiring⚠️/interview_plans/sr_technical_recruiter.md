## Recruiting Sales Funnel (1 hour)

A good recruiter is able to determine a “qualified lead” (>25% likely to pass interviews, >50% likely to accept if they pass) based on a candidate’s resume and a quick conversation. As the process progresses they can determine what doubts the candidate might have and help them resolve those doubts via follow-up conversations, introductions, etc. They realize their role goes beyond just the process to really get the candidate to “buy” Doxel. They do this by building a deep understanding of Doxel, the teams they are supporting, and the nuances of each team they are hiring into - and matching it all to the candidate in question. ~4 hires/month (on technical side) is a good benchmark.

A great recruiter is able to influence the candidate’s decision-making framework to increase the probability of getting a “yes” - and having a great impact @ Doxel. From the very first conversation they build a map of _how_ the candidate will reach a decision and help the candidate change the map - if needed - or navigate it to reach the right outcome (even if that isn’t Doxel!). They gain so much trust from the candidate that these individuals share other offers, doubts about Doxel/other companies, etc willingly. They do this with a mixture of psychology, coaching, grasp of frameworks (e.g. Maslow), personal relationship, and a deep belief that the job is to find mutual fit - not selling. Since they are able to increase the pool of qualified leads, they get ~50% more hires than good recruiters for the same amount of effort (~6 technical hires/month).

Example interview script:



* Tell me about a senior candidate that you landed successfully that **required a lot of work on your part** (15 min)
    * **Watch out:** 
        * really dig into “what did **you** do to help land this candidate?” You should be able to tell the story of how this candidate would NOT have joined if the Recruiter hadn’t done X, Y, Z.
        * If they go into a candidate that doesn’t sound like they actually contributed much - cut it off, move to another example. You may need to go through 2 or 3 - if you don’t find one, then it’s a sign that they don’t know how to do this.
    * Good answer:
        * They have examples where they were able to find reasons that the candidate might say “no” and how they resolved those reasons (more data about the company, conversations with different people, etc).
        * They clearly had an excellent understanding of the nuances of the role they were hiring for - including the personality of the hiring manager, team, and candidate. They are able to explain why the candidate is the right “puzzle piece” that fits into this role well.
    * Great answer: 
        * They immediately discuss where the candidate was in their decision making cycle and how they helped them think it through. When you ask about competing offers they tell the story of how they were _advising_ the candidate to think through all their options. 
* Tell me about a senior candidate that you _lost_ _in the offer stage _and what you should have done differently (15 min)
    * **Watch out**: 
        * Don’t accept a “there was nothing we could do, Google offered more money/better role/etc.” Find out why they didn’t cut those candidates _earlier_ so they wouldn’t waste time going through all the interviews.
    * Good answer:
        * Recruiter talks about how they (or the process) didn’t paint a compelling enough picture of the opportunity. They have solid ideas on what would have gotten the candidate from a “no” to a “yes” - dig in and ask “why would that have have been enough?” Ideally, they implemented this for future candidates.  
    * Great answer:
        * Recruiter laments that they _missed something in the candidate’s decision making framework_ and discusses how they could have uncovered that earlier before the offer.
* Let’s do a 30 minute roleplay: assume this is the first call with me for a position in your company. 
    * **Watch out**:
        * Roleplay is hard; only do this question if you feel comfortable realistically roleplaying and getting data from it. BE YOURSELF in this roleplay and have the recruiter try to recruit you!
    * Good answer:
        * Recruiter has a good balance of learning about you, your interests, where you are in your career and explaining the opportunity in a compelling way.
        * You walk out thinking the job might be a good one (watch out! Don’t leave Doxel please!)
    * Great answer:
        * Recruiter challenges how you are thinking about your career and next steps you could take. S/he helps sharpen your thinking through some tough but insightful questions. 
        * You walk out feeling you learned something about your possible paths.


## Trusted Coach

A good recruiter is able to identify the hiring managers/interviews that need help and raise it up a relevant party… [MORE HERE]

A great recruiter should be up-leveling the hiring skills of each Hiring Manager and the interviewing skills of each Interviewer. Since their job requires coaching others they must be able to build rapport, gain trust, and effectively teach both beginner-level individuals and advanced individuals. They do this by observing the team in action and providing feedback once they’ve built good rapport. SANDWICH APPROACH??

Example interview script:



* How would you discover the necessary attributes a hiring manager wants in a candidate/role? [10 min]
    * **Watch out**: 
        * This can be very generic. Use a specific role: e.g. “I’m trying to hire a machine learning engineer to help us with object detection.” Have them actually ask you questions to see what you need in the role and what you don’t. 
        * Have them summarize back to you what you told them and see if they hit on the important elements.
    * Good answer:
        * Candidate can dig in and keep asking why. We need candidates that have an idea of how to move the process forward and are not just going to follow a job description.
        * Candidate discusses watching the team in action, getting to know the eng/product roadmap, etc. 
    * Great answer:
        * Candidate comes back with example profiles and uses them to help calibrate.
        * Candidate talks about calibrating throughout the process - after every onsite interview, every cut, etc.
* Have you had to advise a hiring manager on an incorrect hire? Or having a bad process? Or poor interviewers on her team? Discuss an experience where you had to not only educate, but convince a hiring manager. [15 min]
    * **Watch out: **
        * 
    * Good answer:
        * 
    * Great answer:
        * Candidate doesn’t blame the manager in any way whatsoever - very positive, very helpful, clearly describes how they helped the manager improve and land candidates.
* What are the most necessary items in a hiring plan? 
    * Candidate should confidently describe the major milestones and why. It isn’t incredibly important what are the milestones, but that they have a clear vision and can articulate why those elements are important. 
* What would you like to learn from me that will help you sell the company better to candidates? [15 min]
    * Give them 15 minutes to ask questions about the company. Judge them on the quality of their questions: they should be going into company mission, strategy, culture, founder personalities/strengths/weaknesses, customers, engineering projects/problems, etc. It should **not** sound like a “recruiter” talking to you - more like an investor or consultant. 


## Hiring Process Building

A good recruiter is able to adopt a hiring process, improve it slightly, and run it very cleanly. They are able to measure it and provide recommendations when the process isn’t working well (e.g. too many candidates lost after onsite interviews, or candidates not walking away with a good understanding of the role). Good recruiters know the status of every candidate and ensure they move the process quickly by leveraging tools, 1:1s, meetings, etc effectively. 

Great recruiters are able to design the process from the ground up by consulting with their hiring managers. They can re-use existing parts of the process where it works and change the interview types, formats, etc as needed to really optimize hiring for specific roles. Great recruiters are obsessed with numbers and will look at metrics much deeper than good recruiters. Great recruiters know that the process ends **months** after the candidate has joined because the real goal is integrating them into the organization and helping them have impact - it’s not a “butt-in-seats” job. 

Example interview script:



* Tell me about how you took over the hiring process at the last startup you joined. How did you go from being the new person to delivering hires? [15 min]
    * **Watch out**: This question will require a lot of follow ups and should be interactive! Example questions:
        * What did you like about the hiring process they had? What did you not like?
        * What were their metrics before you joined? How did you improve those metrics, and what were the numbers like after your improvements?
        * How did you convince people to change the process?
        * Tell me a story about a hiring manager who was very hard to convince - what did you do?
        * Tell me a story about a candidate you lost because your team moved too slowly. 
    * Good answer:
        * Candidate should be able to describe the major steps in the process. 
        * Candidate should have a rough sense of what the numbers looked like - even if “we were losing ¾ of candidates in the offer stage” is good enough. 
        * Candidate should have a good sense of how their improvements affected numbers. “We moved to 75% acceptance”
        * Candidate should brag (a little) about the number of hires they did after they joined - and it should be tied back to the changes they made. Recruiters should be proud of landing candidates. 
    * Great answer:
        * Candidate should be able to compare the major steps in the process compared to their **ideal** process. It isn’t incredibly important what they are, but that they have a clear vision and can articulate why those elements are important and what was matching/missing.
        * Candidate should know **all the statistics** off the top of their head - before and after improvements.
        * Candidate should have basically torn-down their existing hiring process and redesigned it - with a reasonable amount of consensus-building, hiring manager training, and metrics review. 
* What is one new thing you’ve always wanted to try in a hiring process that you’ve never been able to experiment with? [10 min]
    * **Watch out**: 
        * this question is intended to test for their creativity. Great people always dream big and push the envelope. They might not know right away (maybe nobody has ever asked them!) so push them on it and let them think quietly for 1-2 minutes if they need to.
        * Ask “why?” a few times. Really understand what they are trying to get out of this idea.
    * Good answer:
        * Candidate may need to reflect for a few minutes - clearly hasn’t thought about it before - but has a decent idea once pushed.
        * Candidate has some interesting ideas that they’ve seen other recruiters do and they want to copycat them. When pushed “why?” they aren’t 100% sure those are good things to try, but they seem “interesting”. 
    * Great answer: 
        * Candidate has a handful of ideas right off the bat - clearly they have been thinking about this quite a bit!
        * Candidate’s ideas are innovative and when pushed on “why?” they have very solid first-principles thinking on why these experiments may lead to a much stronger hiring process.
* For every step in the hiring funnel what are the metrics you look at, what do you consider “good” numbers, and what do you consider “great” numbers? [15 min]
    * **Watch out**:
        * It’s easy to put up fake numbers. Ask them the “best numbers they’ve hit” in each category.
    * Good answer:
        * Candidate has the basic steps in the hiring funnel: sourcing, recruiter screen, hiring manager screen, phone screen, onsite interviews, cultural interviews, reference checks, closing. They might have them in different orders, or more/fewer steps, but overall they have a good sense of each step.
        * FINISH THIS
    * Great answer:
        * Candidate has steps _after_ hiring: e.g. 1-month attrition, 6-month attrition, performance scores after joining, etc. 
        * FINISH THIS
* What would you like to learn from me that will help you sell the company better to candidates? [15 min]
    * Give them 15 minutes to ask questions about the company. Judge them on the quality of their questions: they should be going into company mission, strategy, culture, founder personalities/strengths/weaknesses, customers, engineering projects/problems, etc. It should **not** sound like a “recruiter” talking to you - more like an investor or consultant.

-CANDIDATE FLOW

-TIME-TO-HIRE

-Scheduling, sourcing, closing...



* 
* Tell me about the last two times you used data to help you recruit. 
* What is the best way to get a team aligned on a hiring process? How have you been successful in communicating updates to the team? Especially when the process goes long? 
* You will be asked to manage multiple hiring processes at the same time. What do you do to ensure none of the balls drop? What are the most important things to stay on top of? 
    * Hiring multiple candidates is paramount. Interviewer should get strong feedback on how capable the candidate is on following through and ensuring our first impression on external candidates is impeccable. 
* Tell me about a time where you worked in a fast-paced culture. What did you do to ensure you met project/task deadlines? Any specific tricks or tools that you used? 
* Abnormal is very data driven and the candidate will need to juggle managing multiple KPIs, in addition to hiring team members. How would the candidate sequence/prioritize these things 
    * Engaging the candidate’s critical thinking skills and seeing how they make tradeoffs in order to prioritize and succeed when asked to do multiple things.


## Key Recruiting Skills



* What do you think are the best resources for sourcing applicants for job openings? 
    * Look for candidates who show initiative in hiring, rather than only waiting for applicants to answer job postings, and who demonstrate a working knowledge of HR resources and databases. 
    * How would you source for a CSM in a construction tech company? How would you source for a PM?


## Topgrading  



* When communicating with possible recruits, what would be the things you focus on? Is it responsibilities, or hiring team, or salary?
    * Again, not as important on which tactic is used, but really dig into how they would communicate and discuss this. Being able to convey passion will be very important for this role.
