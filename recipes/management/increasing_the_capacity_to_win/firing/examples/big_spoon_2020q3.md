#360 Written Feedback
Per expectations set in our conversations and emails on 7/15, 8/20, and 9/10 I’ve reviewed your work in the last quarter over the following dimensions:



* Total output & impact.
* Quality-improving activities like code reviews and unit testing.
* Communication to manager, team, and peers.
* Delivering on project commitments

While I have seen some improvement in the last two points your overall output and impact at the company is still **below my expectations **of a Senior Software Engineer.

**Output**

From 9/8-10/15 you had 32 commits checked-in. It was good to see that you’ve started splitting up your work into smaller pieces and pushing on a more regular basis per my feedback. However, when I looked at the total _output_ it was quite low. The changes from 9/11 to 10/5 (about 3 weeks) glued together an existing pipeline for reviewing in LB without any major additions. This is 2-3x longer than it should have taken a senior engineer familiar with the Annotation code base. The only other major output was the large crops/speedup work, which also took many weeks (it was started the week of 8/20 and checked-in 9/9, so 2-3 weeks). Overall work seems to take you 2x-3x longer than expected for the scope.

**Quality**

I was disappointed to see that in all of the last 6 weeks of Q3 you did not provide any major code reviews to any team members. You mostly seem to LGTM/rubber stamp code without providing feedback to help them catch errors or factor work better. In some cases, people after you (including myself) have come and given deeper code reviews. In other cases, REDACTED and REDACTED asked you for code reviews and never got them. A senior engineer, especially one of our stronger C++ developers, should be constantly up-leveling the rest of the team via code review.

On the testing side I was also disappointed. The [Large Crops/Speedup]() implementation was the perfect moment to write unit tests; instead, you added a test a [month later]() that didn’t even check correctness. Other changes, e.g. [REDACTED](), already had unit tests and you didn’t update them. I couldn’t find a single example of your work improving on, or even meeting, the current level of testing. We discussed this on 7/15 and I specifically said I’d be looking for “_Testing: I want to see your ability to write high-quality code and tests.”_

**Communication**

Communication has improved in some cases and not in others. On JIRA your documentation has gotten better: I saw numerous examples of work explained and linked to PRs. However, at standups and Slack your team/project-based communication continues to be sub-par. You aren’t raising red flags proactively enough to help your team help you. Your participation in team meetings were not quite productive and informative given the deep involvement you had in the team for Q1 and Q2 - specially around why certain decisions have been taken in the past. We got stuck in discussions of lingering issues - rather than proposed & viable solutions. As a whole, the team was deprived of the well-communicated guidance & learning that it should have gotten from a senior engineer working in the team working for more than two quarters (on certain problem statements eg. robust cropping, productization of point cloud diff etc. even longer than that).

**Delivering on project commitments**

After our discussions your project management improved. On the MPF: Supports project you moved from milestone to milestone with more urgency and got yourself unblocked by working with Justin, Matt, etc. However, I noticed that the project scope was cut significantly - and in some cases, unhelpfully - in order to hit these deadlines. Two major parts of the project were supposed to be foundations for future work: “dynamic cropping” to help us find the supports on the pipe but not where modeled, and Clevis Hanger identification to help us find supports that might be twisted or otherwise differ. No work was done on these and instead you mostly cleaned up an existing pipeline and turned it on for these objects. A senior engineer thinks towards the future and builds software now that will solve upcoming problems. Your designs have not been reusable or forward-looking.

Overall I’ve seen some improvements in your work over the last quarter but not enough to meet our bar of Senior Engineer.

# Final Conversation
After sharing that 360 with him this is the follow-up conversation I had the next day. I took notes because I was pretty stressed about it.

* Good morning Big Spoon. Thank you for joining us today. You and I have had numerous conversations about your performance over the last quarter, which I summarized and shared in the 360 you got yesterday. Based on what we’ve seen, we’ve decided that it’s best for you to seek other employment opportunities at this time. <pause>
* Before we discuss the details, I’d like to pause here to answer any of your questions. (questions)
* You will receive your final paycheck today. Your health benefits are active through the end of the month and you have the option to sign up for the company COBRA plan. In addition, we are offering you a severance package of 2 weeks of salary if you review and sign the release agreement which you will receive in your personal email inbox shortly.
* Is your email still REDACTED
