I recently spent some time reviewing your work from the last six weeks and I’m disappointed about the amount of progress you’ve made. We brought [PEER] into the team this quarter so you could be less distracted by leadership tasks and focus your computer vision skills on key problems facing the company. To see how you were doing, I analyzed your PRs, recently resolved JIRAs, and your commitments in the OKRs and Q3 MPF milestones.

Some key problems:

* Crop diff: this project was started 4 months ago, I reminded you on 7/15 that we should get it into production, and your MPF milestone on 8/15 was supposed to present the ML performance improvements. That still has not been completed.
* MPF: Supports project. This was your main OKR for the quarter and is an important part of our Facebook launch. Your MPF milestone of 8/15 was supposed to have a functional LabelBox project for marking if hangers were present. This project hasn’t started yet and we have <5 weeks left in the quarter and <4 weeks to Facebook pilot launch. It sounds like you changed the priority/ownership of this without my input and we risk missing the FB deadline now.
* Your overall code velocity is very low. I asked on 7/15 in email and in-person to aim for one major feature launch per week; in the last 5 weeks (4 working weeks) the only major improvement I’m aware of is improving the RAM utilization. A lot of your work stays “in-flight” for way too long or never is checked in; I’ve personally closed several of your very-old PRs that seem important but somehow never get merged. Your contributions outside of cropping are still minimal, something that was provided in your Manager Review in December 2019, which prevents you from having the needed impact on the team.

On top of that, previous feedback on communication has not been improved upon. Your PRs still don’t have good descriptions, JIRAs are not well-documented, verbal communication is hard to follow, and email/slack communication is minimal (especially around project progress). On the leadership front, you’re missing your commitments and it’s not clear when you say “yes” to something if your heart is really in it - or if you disagree and are uncomfortable pushing back. 

I need to see a significant improvement in velocity and impact by the end of the quarter if you want to continue working at Doxel. Let’s discuss in our 1:1 today on exact expectations and your plan on how to get there.
