# Performance Reviews âœ…
Ah, performance reviews! Every manager's favorite time of year... not. So many employees and managers alike fear this process. Sometimes its the tedium, paper-pushing feeling. Sometimes it's the nauseating self-agrandizement and politicking encouraged by the approach. And, often, it's the realization that you would need a hundred hours to provide really meaningful feedback to your entire team and you just don't have that kind of time.

But... how you review and compensate your people is the "sharp end" of your culture. In the end, all the words you use to describe yourselves are empty if they aren't backed up by praises & raises during a Review Cycle. There is _no way_ to avoid having a Performance Review Process, because even if you have no process -- that _is_ your process. Employees know that you are judging their performance against others. They expect occasional increases in compensation, usually yearly, sometimes more frequently. While there is no "right way" to do performance reviews, and no "right time" to implement a process, no review cycles mean you are OK with your employees being stressed out because they don't know if they are meeting expectation. It means you are OK rewarding the squeakiest wheel that comes complaining to you about comp, rather than your top performer who is silently shipping features left and right. Perhaps that's OK for the stage of your team/company. We would venture, though, that even a VERY lightweight process is better than no process. 

But why can't we managers do much, much better? What's preventing us from turning performance reviews into the most rewarding time of the year? If feedback is a gift then why aren't we treating it like Christmas?? Aren't we incredibly lucky to have such talented people working for us? Let's have fun celebrating their accomplishments! Aren't we incredibly lucky to be surrounded by such motivated individuals? Let's hold up a mirror to help them see what they need to grow even further! We are blessed with the opportunity to change people's lives for the better. Let's embrace this moment and give it everything we have.

There is, unfortunately, no magic process or recipe that will accomplish the above. There is only your mindset. If you eargerly away performance reviews, if you show your excitement, then you have a chance of infecting others with your enthusiasm. If you dread their arrival, if you procrastinate, then you'll play into your employee's worst fears that performance reviews here will suck, like they do everywhere else. 

So before you try any of these recipes, work on yourself.

# Major Components
Every performance review system we've seen or heard of is made up of the parts below. Each is done differently in different places; some are skipped entirely. We'll explain the purposes of each below, and walk through specific recipes to give you a feeling of some things you could try.

## Self-Reviews
These are reviews written by the employee themselves. They may or may not be shared with other employees; they are always shared with the Engineering Manager + HR. They can be completely open-ended or strictly adhere to some template per process. There are several reasons why we'd recommend having self-reviews:

1. Employees own their own careers, ultimately. No one else _can_ be responsible for their growth or advancement over the years. As their manager, you should obviously help them, and you might feel completely responsible -- but you may not be their manager one day. Having them think about their performance is an important step in having them think about their career. Teach them to fish.
1. Peers (and you!) may not remember everything the employee has done. Everyone is busy; having the employee document their most important accomplishments, strengths, and areas for growth will help everyone provide more relevant feedback.


### Ingredients ðŸš§ 
You can have folks write self-reviews with no prerequisites... In fact, this might even be a good idea when taking over a team that doesn't have enough process. In the long run, however, 'naked' self-reviews that don't refer back to any goals, level expectations, or role expectations will devolve into self-aggrandisement and politicking. Try to get these ingredients in-place WAY before you try to cook up self-reviews.

* [Personal GoalsðŸ“„](): what was this individual supposed to accomplish since the last performance review?
* [Team GoalsðŸ“„](): what was the team supposed to accomplish since the last review? Is our employee amplifying team performance as well, or too selfishly working on their own goals?
* [Level ExpectationsðŸ“„](): what are the competencies/behaviors expected at the employee's level? 
* [Role ExpectationsðŸ“„](): what are the competencies/behaviors expected in this role?
* [Company Virtues/ValuesðŸ“„](): what are the overall company values that the employee should be displaying?

### Dobromir's Self-Review Recipe
I personally really value spending time reviewing my performance. I spend a lot of time on it - often 8+ hours, at least once a year. I encourage my people to also put a big chunk in, perhaps ~4 hours, and definitely not less than 2. The written review should end up at least 2 pages, sometimes 4-6 is appropriate. Most recently I've used [this template](dobromir_2021_review_process.md) which is pretty lightweight. Descriptions of the sections are below.

I also "code review" these self-review drafts before publishing them out. Most engineers are not very good at talking about their accomplishments, growth areas, and areas for improvement. By asking them questions or pointing out where they need more detail it helps them tell their own stories better. That serves them well later in their careers.

#### Responsibilities & Project Section
Repeat this section 3-6 times, depending on the lookback period of the self-review. I've found that roughly 6-8 weeks should translate nicely into one section. 

1. Project Name or Responsibility & 1-paragraph description. 
    1. This is mostly to ensure people not super-familiar with the project know what you've been working on. It has the nice added benefit of communicating across the organization different projects that are being worked on.
    2. I call it 'responsibility or project' because sometimes folks have open-ended roles, like "TL", that deserve their own section.
2. Your contributions to this responsibility/project. 
    1. 1-2 paragraphs. Here I am looking for an actual story about how they contributed. Generally just bullet-points don't cut it for me because it doesn't paint the picture of why the work mattered.
    2. VERY IMPORTANT to have documentation: docs you wrote, pull requests, code reviews, links to metrics. _No documentation is a big no-no_. I'll send it back to the employee if they aren't documenting their contributions.
3. **Impact** of your contribution to the project (small, medium, large, critical).
    1. This helps calibrate across employees later. 
    1. It's also a good yellow flag if you see someone constantly claiming 'large' or 'critical' impact and you've heard from others they are not doing that much. People will usually inflate their impact a little so only look for huge inflation. Either expectations are wrong, or our employee is blind to their actual team performance. Both will require your attention.
4. 1-2 ideas of what you could have done better. 1 paragraph.
    1. I love this question because it tends to ellicit more precise answers than the later "Areas for Improvement" section. You can also compare what they say to their peers, if you are getting peer feedback.
    1. This section will often help you identify employee [blind spotsðŸ“„](). Look for patterns across projects here to determine if you need to unlock new [dimensional thinkingðŸ“„]().
    
#### Strengths Section
Repeat this section 2-3 times. Make sure the instructions include giving examples where this strength made a big different to their impact and/or team output.

You will mostly use this to see if their peers agree; if not, you have excellent [blind spotsðŸ“„]() to work on.

Refer to your [Level ExpectationsðŸ“„]() and [Role ExpectationsðŸ“„]() if you can. Ideally your employees are finding strengths in the areas you need them to be strong :)


#### Areas for Improvement Section
Repeat this section 1-2 times. Again, make sure the instructions include giving examples where the employee _could have_ had more impact and/or team output, if they improved here.

I generally recommend limiting the number of "areas for improvement" because it can be demoralizing to have half a dozen things listed here. If you are able to help your employee find -- and improve -- just ONE area over the next 12 months, you're probably already doing better than 90% of managers!

Feel free to refer to the expectations again for this section. The more you do that, the more those expectations become "real" and not just a document you wrote that everyone ignores :)

#### Demonstration of Company Virtues
I make the Virtues a required part of the self-review -- that way they have 'teeth'. Each employee must rank themselves 1-5 on each Virtue and provide a bullet point on what they need to get to the next level. If they are a 5 (you should have quite a few!) then they need to include one bullet on how they can help _someone else_ improve -- since that's what 5s are supposed to do...

# Putting It Together

# Scratch
You claim to be a "growth factory" --> prove it.
You claim to reward your top performers --> prove it.
You claim you don't tolerate poor performers --> but do you have the guts to give them a PIP when the whole team complains? Prove it.
You claim you have a 'no assholes' rule --> so why did you give an 'exceed expectations' to your best coder that everyone hates working with?
You claim to run a tight ship --> but you don't do performance reviews, because then it forces all those conversations above AND you need to explain to your top people why you aren't paying them more...

If you love geeking out about review processes...

How you review & compensate your people is the "sharp end" of your culture.  Try not to be one of the 90% of L&Ms who says one thing and does another.

May or may not feed directly into comp changes ("coupled" or "decoupled" feedback).

No surprises
help people grow --> don't just treat it like paperwork!
Mechanical vs personal.

Public or private feedback? 
--> Twitter sharing my private feedback with all my peers!
--> Always shared my self-review with my team, and encouraged others to do so as well.
--> Sharing my previous 360s here.
--> Impressed by sales QBRs where they basically need to do a "public 360"!!
