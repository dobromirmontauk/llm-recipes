# Performance Reviews âœ…
Ah, performance reviews! Every engineers's favorite time of year... not. So many employees and managers alike fear this season. Sometimes its the tedium, paper-pushing feeling. Sometimes it's the nauseating self-agrandizement and politicking encouraged by the process. And, often, it's the realization that you would need a hundred hours to provide really meaningful feedback to your entire team and you just don't have that kind of time.

But... how you review and compensate your people is the "sharp end" of your culture. In the end, all the words you use to describe yourselves are empty if they aren't backed up by **praises & raises** during a Review Cycle. There is _no way_ to avoid having a Performance Review Process, because even if you have no process -- that _is_ your process. Employees know that you are judging their performance against others. They know you will fire people who don't meet expectations, even if those have never been vergalized. They expect occasional increases in compensation, usually yearly, sometimes more frequently. While there is no "right way" to do performance reviews, and no "right time" to implement a process, not having a review process means you are OK with your employees being stressed out because they don't know how they are **officially** performing. It means you are OK rewarding the squeakiest wheel that comes complaining to you about comp, rather than your top performer who is silently shipping features left and right. Perhaps that's OK for the stage of your team/company. We would venture, though, that even a VERY lightweight process is better than no process. Find the right recipe below.

## A Challenge to All Us Managers

But why can't we managers do much, much better? What's preventing us from turning performance reviews into the most rewarding time of the year? If feedback is a gift then why aren't we treating it like Christmas?? Aren't we incredibly lucky to have such talented people working for us? Let's have fun celebrating their accomplishments! Aren't we incredibly lucky to be surrounded by such motivated individuals? Let's hold up a mirror to help them see what they need to grow even further! We are blessed with the opportunity to change people's lives for the better. Let's embrace this moment and give it everything we have.

There is, unfortunately, no magic process or recipe that will accomplish the above. There is only your mindset. If you eargerly away performance reviews, if you show your excitement, then you have a chance of infecting others with your enthusiasm. If you dread their arrival, if you procrastinate, then you'll play into your employee's worst fears that performance reviews here will suck, like they do everywhere else. 

So before you try any of these recipes, work on yourself.

# Major Components
Every performance review system we've seen or heard of is made up of the parts below. Each is done differently in different places; some are skipped entirely. We'll explain the purposes of each below, and walk through specific recipes to give you a feeling of some things you could try. 

Jump to #Putting It Together if you want to see some examples of end-to-end process documentation.

## Self-Reviews
These are reviews written by the employee themselves. They may or may not be shared with other employees; they are always shared with the Engineering Manager + HR. They can be completely open-ended or strictly adhere to some template per process. There are several reasons why we'd recommend having self-reviews:

1. Employees own their own careers, ultimately. No one else _can_ be responsible for their growth or advancement over the years. As their manager, you should obviously help them, and you might feel completely responsible -- but you may not be their manager one day. Having them think about their performance is an important step in having them think about their career. Teach them to fish.
1. Peers (and you!) may not remember everything the employee has done. Everyone is busy; having the employee document their most important accomplishments, strengths, and areas for growth will help everyone provide more relevant feedback.


### Ingredients ðŸš§ 
You can have folks write self-reviews with no prerequisites... In fact, this might even be a good idea when taking over a team that doesn't have enough process. In the long run, however, 'naked' self-reviews that don't refer back to any goals, level expectations, or role expectations will devolve into self-aggrandisement and politicking. Try to get these ingredients in-place WAY before you try to cook up self-reviews.

* [Personal GoalsðŸ“„](): what was this individual supposed to accomplish since the last performance review?
* [Team GoalsðŸ“„](): what was the team supposed to accomplish since the last review? Is our employee amplifying team performance as well, or too selfishly working on their own goals?
* [Level ExpectationsðŸ“„](): what are the competencies/behaviors expected at the employee's level? 
* [Role ExpectationsðŸ“„](): what are the competencies/behaviors expected in this role?
* [Company Virtues/ValuesðŸ“„](): what are the overall company values that the employee should be displaying?

### Dobromir's Self-Review Recipe
I personally really value spending time reviewing my performance. I spend a lot of time on it - often 8+ hours, at least once a year. I encourage my people to also put a big chunk in, perhaps ~4 hours, and definitely not less than 2. The written review should end up at least 2 pages, sometimes 4-6 is appropriate. Most recently I've used [this template](dobromir_2021_review_process.md) which is pretty lightweight. Descriptions of the sections are below.

I also "code review" these self-review drafts before publishing them out. Most engineers are not very good at talking about their accomplishments, growth areas, and areas for improvement. By asking them questions or pointing out where they need more detail it helps them tell their own stories better. That serves them well later in their careers.

#### Responsibilities & Project Section
Repeat this section 3-6 times, depending on the lookback period of the self-review. I've found that roughly 6-8 weeks should translate nicely into one section. 

1. Project Name or Responsibility & 1-paragraph description. 
    1. This is mostly to ensure people not super-familiar with the project know what you've been working on. It has the nice added benefit of communicating across the organization different projects that are being worked on.
    2. I call it 'responsibility or project' because sometimes folks have open-ended roles, like "TL", that deserve their own section.
2. Your contributions to this responsibility/project. 
    1. 1-2 paragraphs. Here I am looking for an actual story about how they contributed. Generally just bullet-points don't cut it for me because it doesn't paint the picture of why the work mattered.
    2. VERY IMPORTANT to have documentation: docs you wrote, pull requests, code reviews, links to metrics. _No documentation is a big no-no_. I'll send it back to the employee if they aren't documenting their contributions.
3. **Impact** of your contribution to the project (small, medium, large, critical).
    1. This helps calibrate across employees later. 
    1. It's also a good yellow flag if you see someone constantly claiming 'large' or 'critical' impact and you've heard from others they are not doing that much. People will usually inflate their impact a little so only look for huge inflation. Either expectations are wrong, or our employee is blind to their actual team performance. Both will require your attention.
4. 1-2 ideas of what you could have done better. 1 paragraph.
    1. I love this question because it tends to ellicit more precise answers than the later "Areas for Improvement" section. You can also compare what they say to their peers, if you are getting peer feedback.
    1. This section will often help you identify employee [blind spotsðŸ“„](). Look for patterns across projects here to determine if you need to unlock new [dimensional thinkingðŸ“„]().
    
#### Strengths Section
Repeat this section 2-3 times. Make sure the instructions include giving examples where this strength made a big different to their impact and/or team output.

You will mostly use this to see if their peers agree; if not, you have excellent [blind spotsðŸ“„]() to work on.

Refer to your [Level ExpectationsðŸ“„]() and [Role ExpectationsðŸ“„]() if you can. Ideally your employees are finding strengths in the areas you need them to be strong :)


#### Areas for Improvement Section
Repeat this section 1-2 times. Again, make sure the instructions include giving examples where the employee _could have_ had more impact and/or team output, if they improved here.

I generally recommend limiting the number of "areas for improvement" because it can be demoralizing to have half a dozen things listed here. If you are able to help your employee find -- and improve -- just ONE area over the next 12 months, you're probably already doing better than 90% of managers!

Feel free to refer to the expectations again for this section. The more you do that, the more those expectations become "real" and not just a document you wrote that everyone ignores :)

#### Demonstration of Company Virtues
I make the Virtues a required part of the self-review -- that way they have 'teeth'. Each employee must rank themselves 1-5 on each Virtue and provide a bullet point on what they need to get to the next level. If they are a 5 (you should have quite a few!) then they need to include one bullet on how they can help _someone else_ improve -- since that's what 5s are supposed to do...

#### Examples
I have my self-reviews going back almost 15 years now. I'm happy to share examples of how I do this for myself if you reach out to ask.

## Peer Feedback
Peer feedback, also called 360 degree feedback, is a process where peers get to give each other feedback. In this case 'peers' are usually anyone in the company other than the direct manager; it can include other teams, other departments, or even skip-level managers. This process is often run as part of the Review/Compensation cycle, but sometimes you'll see it run completely independently, to make it clearer that is feedback for growth and does not impact the employee's compensation. Use your judgement.

A peer feedback process isn't always the right thing to implement. Here's a short list of pros/cons. Feel free to add more :)

Pros:

* Helps avoid politics by limiting manager power in the review process.
* Helps team dynamics by making it clear you need to support your peers.
* Helps managers understand their employees better.
* Makes peers more involved in the growth of team mates.

Cons: 

* Expensive! It takes a lot of time; imagine each peer is asked to rate 4-6 others, and it takes 2-3 hours. You could be spending almost 2 entire business days *across everyone* 
* It can increase politics if peers tribelize and have an 'us-vs-them' attitude.
* Insensitive peer reviews can inflame tensions across a team.


### Ingredients
* [Self-review](#Self-Reviews): this is optional but recommended. Share the self-reviews with everyone doing a peer review so they have a chance to refresh their memories.
* Peer choosing algorithm: there are 3 main ways of doing this, you can mix & match if you'd like. 
    * Let folks choose their own reviewers. 
    * Have managers choose the reviewers.
    * Automatically choose reviewers based on code interactions, team structure, email exchanges, etc.

### Dobromir's Written Peer Feedback Recipe
I used to request written feedback during peer reviews, using the script below, which basically follows the [Self Review](#Self-Review) script.

```
1. Project Section (repeated for every project in Self Review):
    1. What was impressive about the employeeâ€™s contributions to this project?
    2. How could the employee have contributed even more to this project?
2. Strengths Section (repeated for every strength in Self Review):
    3. Do you agree with this strength? Give examples of yes/no.
3. AFI Section (repeated for every AFI in Self Review):
    4. Do you agree with this AFI? Give examples of yes/no.
4. One more thingâ€¦
    5. If you could magically change one thing about your peer, what would it be?
```

The challenge with this recipe is that if you have ~5 reports and each has ~5 peer reviews, you need to manage 25 responses. Invariably, the responses end up being vague, or you have some questions you'd like to follow up on, or you have a pattern you noticed from a couple of reviewers and you'd like one more data point... And so you end up spending a lot of time going back to reviewers. 

### Dobromir's Interview Peer Feedback Recipe
I use this recipe more than the one above now. Kudos go out to [Joseph Unruh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephunruh/) for teaching me how to do this.

Instead of asking for written feedback, I basically do the above but in an interview setting. 15 minutes is often enough to get 80% of the value; 30 minutes is almost always enough for any level of seniority. I take live notes during the conversation. Reviewers really appreciate not having to spend hours wordsmithing a document; they save time and I save time as well. 

Follow-up questions are key here. Learning to be a good [Interviewer](/tools/interviewing.md) is really important. 


## Manager Review
This is the Main Dish. You can skip pretty much every other part of a review process, but you can't skip this one. If the employee doesn't get a review from their manager then you can't call it a 'review process'.

The purpose of a Manager Review is to motivate the employee so you get higher performance from them going forward ('increase capacity to win'). That's the only purpose from the business's perspective. You might have additional reasons (good!) but don't accidentally confuse them with this one. You should choose the review process that maximizes future 'capacity to win' (while balancing this with current 'winning', of course). That might mean, in some organizations, spending more time on certain manager reviews and less on others; or even using different recipes for different individuals. You might want to be 'fair' and treat everyone 'equally' but remember that [fairness]() and [equality]() are just other spectrums that you should land on wisely, depending on what your team/company needs at this point.

So how do you motivate an employee in a manager review? There are generally 3 approaches we've seen:

1. Call out what they are doing well. [Positive reinforcement](tools/positive_reinforcement.md) tool!
2. Create a desire for self-improvement. [Carrot](tools/carrot.md) tool!
3. Create a fear of the consequences. [Stick](tools/stick.md) tool!


### Ingredients
* Self-review [optional]
* Peer-reviews [optional]

Note that if you have these ingredients, or the other ingredients earlier, and you _don't use them_, you'll create a ton of confusion. Your manager reviews absolutely must take any self-review, peer feedback, and standards into account. The only thing worse than spending a ton of time writing reviews is then finding out that the manager ignored that input...

### Lighweight Manager Review Recipe
This is the *lightest* review process we can recommend. Do this if you have serious burning business priorities preempting you and "increasing the capacity to win" is basically irrelevant.

1. Choose one of the following ratings for each of your employees:
    1. Does Not Meet Expectations.
    1. Meets Expectations.
    1. Sometimes Exceeds Expectations.
    1. Exceeds Expectations.
    1. Strongly Exceeds Expectations.
1. Shoot an email to your employee as follows:
    1. Subject: Your Rating For QX20XX
    1. Body: "Hi Jane, your rating for QX20XX is '[rating]. Let's discuss your performance in our next 1:1."
    1. **It has to be an email**. Slack is rude. Verbal-only communication does NOT count as an official rating. 
1. In your next 1:1, give a brief explanation why you gave them that rating, and what they can do to improve it next time. Ask if they have any questions.

Note that in this approach you are going in unprepared and with an employee who doesn't quite understand why you gave them the rating you did. The in-person conversation may be heated. The employee might quit. Or perhaps they'll shrug and say 'ok' and keep doing their thing. Use your judgement in this approach; often it's _less_ work to do more of the prep (other recipes) then it is to go hire & train a whole new engineer.


### Dobromir's Manager Review Recipe
I love the challenge of unlocking people's potential by truly understanding them at a deeper level. I'm not incredibly good at it though so I use my manager reviews as a forcing function to both contemplate this question and to experiment with different feedback techniques. That means I'll often gather a ton of 360 feedback, collate it, and add my own thoughts into documents that end up 4-8 pages in length. It's time consuming and I don't recommend that everyone do this. For me, though, it's very meaningful and I've almost never regretted doing it. 

1. Create a working doc for the manager review with a Strengths and an Area for Improvement sections. 
    1. You don't know what these are yet so keep them empty. We'll be using them as a 'staging area' for our thought process.
1. Read the employee's self-review. For each strength/AFI that you agree with, create a new bullet in the staging area for it, and add supporting evidence that the employee called out. For example:
        1. Strengths
            1. Execution
                1. Jane Doe: "I tracked every bug in Project X and how it was doing in QA so I could update our PM on how close we were to release in daily standup."
            1. Python coding
                1. Jane Doe: "I reviewed 50 PRs in the last year, some of which were quite complex, and I left tons of useful comments. See for example <here> and <here>"
1. Read every peer review. For every quote you find insightful, add it as supporting evidence to the appropriate section.
    1. Ideally, you should start seeing 3-5 quotes (sometimes a lot more!) starting to support a strength or AFI.
1. Clean up the strengths/AFIs as follows.
    1. Some might to too big, with too many quotes that feel disjointed. Split these into more granular groupings. 
        1. For example, 'Execution' might have 8 quotes in it, and you notice it's really 2 categories, one around 'Releasing a high-quality product' and the other around 'Communicating clearly with product'
    1. Some might be too small, with only 1-2 quotes. Cut them.
    1. This is the hard part: pick 1-3 strengths and 1-2 AFIs. Cut the rest. Even if the feedback feels SUPER relevant. 
        1. If you don't feel bad deleting some of the feedback, you're doing it wrong :) 
1. Now pull these out into their own sections. You will write your own manager review perspective for each strength/AFI on top of the peer feedback.
    1. Your perspective should be **independent** of what others wrote, although obviously it's influenced by them. 
    1. Try to pull out wisdom from the quotes. Paint the picture to the individual about why this strength is so important, or how they can grow in that AFI.
    1. Keep it to 1-3 paragraphs. The quotes should do most of the work once you've set up the context.
1. Now finish the document with a Summary that starts the document.
    1. In your Summary start with their performance rating. Compare it to previous ratings, if they have any, and explain what's changed.
    1. Focus most of the summary about **what the employee needs to do in the next year**. You should be painting one or more paths for them that would increase their Winning. The more concrete you make it the more likely they will understand your feedback and what they can do about it. 
    1. If you gave them more than one Area for Improvement, only focus on *one* in the Summary. I.e. what is the ONE THING, that if they improved on in the next year, would significantly make them more valuable to the company?
    1. The summary should be about .5 - 1 page in length. It can repeat the parts below and tie them together with more storytelling.
1. Schedule a 1-hour 1:1 at least 1-2 days ahead of time with the employee called "Manager Review".
    1. Tell them they will get the written review one day before the meeting.
    1. Alternatively, you can tell them they will be getting the review at the beginning of the meeting. This sometimes works better with more junior employees, or with very hard to digest reviews.
1. Send the review ahead of time if you said you would.
1. In the review meeting, I like to start as follows:
     1. First, I reiterate the rating. "Hi Jane, thank you for meeting today. You are meeting my expectations as a Sr. SWE, and I was really impressed by XYZ. I think you can exceed my expectations in the next rating cycle if you do XYZ." Keep this short - a couple of sentences.
     1. Then, I like to let the employee choose where to take the conversation. I say something like: "this is your time and I'm here to help you understand the rating and feedback you received. Do you have any questions or topics you'd like to start with?"
         1. **THIS IS KEY**. The only way to know what feedback they've absorbed is to listen to them talk about the review. Are they pensive? Are they defensive? Are they curious? Do they seek to understand or seek to reject? 
     1. If the employee is having a lot of trouble digesting the feedback sometimes I pause the meeting and ask them to sleep on it. This should be rare though. 
     1. If the employee starts pushing back hard, saying "this is not true" or "I don't agree with this feedback", then you need to pull out some of the [advanced techniques](/tools/feedback.md/#Advanced-Techniques)

That concludes the manager review. Of course, it would be a waste to put all that time into a review and then ignore it for the next 12 months, until the next Review Period. Read our other Growth recipes about how to use this Manager Review throughout the year.

## Calibration
Calibration is the process of normalizing performance scores to avoid the [Lake Wobegon effect](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Lake_Wobegon_effect) where "all the children are above average". Calibration is really unavoidable; even it happens implicitly (managers talk to each other in private to cross-reference their people) or explicitly (you set up a process to cross-reference people). Like most things in management, being explicit has advantages -- even you explicitly tell your managers to talk privately :)

Note that the _curve_ is up to you: perhaps you do believe most of your people are 'above average' because you hire that way. Or perhaps you subscribe to the [Vitality Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve) approach. If you'd like to contribute some recipes around how to decide on curves we'd love input!

### Another Challenge!
While the main purpose of calibration is indeed to ensure some amount of fairness across an organization, as managers we can use it for a much more powerful purpose: improving our own management skills. Calibration is a unique moment where _managers come together to discuss their people_. It's the best time to encourage a specific _management_ culture, since you have all your managers in the room. The questions you ask, the focus you have, will reveal your hidden preferences to all YOUR managers. So think carefully about what you want to accomplish in calibration, other than just setting the curve.

### Dobromir's Calibration Recipe (TellApart/Doxel)
Kudos to [Wade Chambers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wadechambers/) for this recipe. He introduced me to it at TellApart in 2015. I was part of a few calibration meetings at Google the years before and this was the first time I saw that calibration could be used to think about _growth_ instead of _horse trading_. The magic came from three things:

1. Visualize your entire team on one board with _forward progress for each individual_ [clearly shown? potential? expected?]
2. Spend most of your time asking "how do we move this individual into the next box?"
3. Get your engineering managers & senior ICs to collaborate on answering the question.

It was fascinating to see how calibration could be MORE than a 

Main question: "how do we help this individual move to the next box"?
The UI makes it more obvious this is the question!!

## Dobromir's Performance Review Recipe
[2021 Process document](dobromir_2021_review_process.md)

# Scratch
You claim to be a "growth factory" --> prove it.
You claim to reward your top performers --> prove it.
You claim you don't tolerate poor performers --> but do you have the guts to give them a PIP when the whole team complains? Prove it.
You claim you have a 'no assholes' rule --> so why did you give an 'exceed expectations' to your best coder that everyone hates working with?
You claim to run a tight ship --> but you don't do performance reviews, because then it forces all those conversations above AND you need to explain to your top people why you aren't paying them more...

If you love geeking out about review processes...

How you review & compensate your people is the "sharp end" of your culture.  Try not to be one of the 90% of L&Ms who says one thing and does another.

May or may not feed directly into comp changes ("coupled" or "decoupled" feedback).

No surprises
help people grow --> don't just treat it like paperwork!
Mechanical vs personal.

Public or private feedback? 
--> Twitter sharing my private feedback with all my peers!
--> Always shared my self-review with my team, and encouraged others to do so as well.
--> Sharing my previous 360s here.
--> Impressed by sales QBRs where they basically need to do a "public 360"!!
