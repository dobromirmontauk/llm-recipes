* Ways to parse a resume
    * Career trajectory
        * Will YOUR job be the RIGHT next job for them? Why or why not? How will it stretch them? Why are they a UNIQUE candidate who can do this job? Why is this job UNIQUE for them?
    * Experience
        * What is REQUIRED experience for this job? Do they need to have solved this problem before - or just been exposed to it? Is a transfer student OK? 
        * Do they have any unique experiences, not required for the job, but that makes them a more interesting candidate?
        * Get this down to 1-2 experiences required, 1-2 “nice to have”
    * Skills
        * Are there particular technologies you need familiarity with? This is easy to find.
        * BE CAREFUL not to require too many. Skills can be learned, a lot easier than mindset can be changed or experience can be gained. You can almost think of this as “what skills do they NEED in the first 3-6 months, because we will teach them everything else OR they will learn what they need to later.”
    * Mindset
        * **How** they wrote their resume will tell you a lot. Are the metrics oriented? Are they a good communicator? Do they care about detail? What do they put first and last? 
    * Culture
        * The companies they are at will define the culture that they have. If you are not familiar with the companies, do a little digging. By default, most company cultures are “meh” - good cultures are the exception.
    * Applied intelligence
        * Do NOT pattern match against what everyone else is pattern matching against. 
        * Applied intelligence is not as rare as you think it is. 
        * Applied intelligence is likely less important for a successful hire than you think it is.
    * PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF GOOD ENOUGH
* In the beginning…
    * WRITE DOWN YOUR CRITERIA AND CIRCULATE IT. Don’t skip this step or you will waste a lot of your own time. You don’t know what you are looking for until you’ve _written it down and strictly ranked the importance._
    * You want to be high recall/low precision. I.e. move a lot of people into the first conversation _with opinions on how they will do_. You use the (a) expectations and (b) reality (first conversation) to determine what is wrong with your (a) scorecard and (b) ability to read resumes.
    * It might even be OK to start by talking to everyone that you run into. Invest 5 hours in this.
    * Structure your conversations so you are not wasting too much time per candidate, since you expect precision to be low.
        * 30 minutes max. Maybe set expectations that you might cut off the conversation after 15 minutes. This shouldn’t happen too often however; I find that I can always learn something in 30 minutes and it is a good use of my time.
        * What is the biggest thing you need in the job, or you think you need? Know this before you have these conversations and make sure in the first 15 minutes you have an opinion on it.
    * Since you are in learning mode you want them to talk as much as possible, and have you talk as little as possible. 
    * You will need to do 10-20 of these before moving into the next phase. Higher if it is a job you are not familiar with/haven’t done before.
* In the middle…
    * You should have changed your criteria quite a bit by actually talking to people. 
    * Your criteria should filter out 90% of resumes at first, then 50%, then 20% as you calibrate with your recruiter. EXPLAIN WHY you are saying “no”.
    * You should have a LOT of candidate flow at this point, something like 1-2 “yes” resumes/day is needed to hire in a reasonable timeframe. So you need much more precision with reasonably high recall at this stage. Aim for 50% precision (cut half the people), with 90% recall (you are likely talking to all the good people).
